I am afraid not, but you can start using Powershell, which does support dot sourcing. Since powershell window is really based on cmd so all your dos command will continue to work, and you gain new power, much more power.
 
I don't think we can do logic or loops because the command processor scans the file at the start. I am OK just having a simple workaround to reuse shared things like environment definitions. Most other things won't need an actual source command (I am hoping). Good luck.

Windows Update is the default repair source, but you can configure Group policy to specify one or more network locations that have the files required to restore a Windows feature or repair a corrupted operating system.
 
You can configure Windows Update as a backup repair source. If you're using Windows Update as a primary or backup repair source, make sure your firewall is configured to allow access to Windows Update.
 
You can use a mounted Windows image from a WIM file as a source to restore optional features and repair a corrupted operating system. For example, c:\mount\Windows. For more information about capturing a Windows image as a WIM file, see Capture Images of Hard Disk Partitions Using DISM.
 
You can use a Windows image (.wim) file on a network share as a source to restore optional features. You must specify the index of the Windows image in the .wim file that you want to use and you must use a Wim: prefix in the path to identify this file format. For example, to specify index 3 in a file named contoso.wim, type: Wim:\\network\images\contoso.wim:3.
 
Open the group policy editor. For example, on a computer that is running Windows 10, from the **Start** screen, type **Edit Group Policy**, and then select **Edit Group Policy** to open the Group Policy Editor.
 
Keep any repair source current with the latest servicing updates. If you're using an image from a WIM file for features, you can use DISM to service the image. For more information, see Mount and Modify a Windows Image Using DISM. If you're using an online Windows installation shared on your local network as a repair image, make sure that the computer has access to Windows Update.
 
You must include all of the relevant language packs with your repair source files for the locales your image supports. If you try to restore a feature without all of the language components that the Windows installation requires for that feature, the installation will fail.

I used a workaround: using anaconda, i created a virtual environment for CellProfiler specifying Python 3.8 then git cloned cellprofiler from repo and followed the rest of the windows instructions ie cd into the CellProfiler folder and:
 
However, I wonder if to be able to follow the windows instructions you should not download python in the folder where you clone the repo?
will try tomorrow, now CP4 is running from source on my pipeline (and I will check if I still have the bug
 
I am having a strange issue building Cellprofiler 5.0.0b1 from source on Windows 10 in a conda environment as described in Source installation (Windows) CellProfiler/CellProfiler Wiki GitHub. I did have to clone and install core as suggested. I cannot run cellprofiler from windows terminal (python okay), and when I try to run in my conda environment I get:

After searching for a solution, I checked that the registry value for LongPathsEnabled was correct python - How to fix [WinError 206] The filename or extension is too long ERROR? - Stack Overflow and changed the group policy The Filename or Extension is too Long? Here's a Fix. Nothing has worked. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!
 
**Note:**The path to the source directory must not contain any spaces or Windows-specific file system characters. The path should also be kept short. This prevents issues with too long file paths in the compilation phase.
 
but now I am confused. I have one server that is off by 10 minutes. yet it is using the same time source as the servers with the correct time. and to make it more fun If I manually correct the time it changes back to being wrong by 10 minutes
 
I just checked and VM Tools was syncing time with the host so I unselected that but it is still showing the wrong Time. I even did a gpupdate and restarted the server hoping it would pull in the correct time
 
If you use w32tm /config it should switch it to the local machine, then run it again with w32tm /config /computer:[PDCe name] /update and see if it corrects its time. Or you could just run w32tm /config /update and see if it logs anything to the Event Log.
 
If the application includes an installation log then it may contain the source path for the install files but the chances are slim (I've checked the install log for Firefox and it has no mention of the source file) as such I'm inclined to say it's not possible to identify the source install for your programs but you shouldn't need to know where the install files where only where the program was installed.
 
In Kaseya you need to specify the working directory. By default this is C:\kworking. For agent procedures you need to know where you saved a file on the machine if you are going to do anything with it. If you saved a file with Kaseya previously and don't know where it went the first thing you should do is go to LiveConnect and look at where the working directory for the machine is. You can also review the agent logs.

It is recommended that most users download the binary distribution for Windows, available as a graphical installer package from the PostgreSQL website at Building from source is only intended for people developing PostgreSQL or extensions.
 
There are several different ways of building PostgreSQL on Windows. The simplest way to build with Microsoft tools is to install Visual Studio 2022 and use the included compiler. It is also possible to build with the full Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 to 2022. In some cases that requires the installation of the Windows SDK in addition to the compiler.
 
Building using MinGW or Cygwin uses the normal build system, see Chapter 17 and the specific notes in Section 17.7.4 and Section 17.7.2. To produce native 64 bit binaries in these environments, use the tools from MinGW-w64. These tools can also be used to cross-compile for 32 bit and 64 bit Windows targets on other hosts, such as Linux and macOS. Cygwin is not recommended for running a production server, and it should only be used for running on older versions of Windows where the native build does not work. The official binaries are built using Visual Studio.

This document will help you get set up to build Firefox on your owncomputer. Getting set up can take a while - we need to download alot of bytes! Even on a fast connection, this can take ten to fifteenminutes of work, spread out over an hour or two.
 
**Mercurial:** Ensure that the hg command works from PowerShell. If it is not set up,download Mercurial/TortoiseHg and ensurethe hg directory is added to your path. For example, this could beC:\Program Files\Mercurial orC:\Program Files\TortoiseHg.
 
Now that your system is ready, we can download the source code and have Firefoxautomatically download the other dependencies it needs. The below commandwill download a lot of data (years of Firefox history!) then guide you throughthe interactive setup process.
 
When running bootstrap.py there will be a UAC (User Account Control) prompt for PowerShell afterselecting the destination directory for the source code clone. This isnecessary to add the Microsoft Defender Antivirus exclusions automatically. Youshould select Yes on the UAC prompt, otherwise you will needto follow some manual steps below.
