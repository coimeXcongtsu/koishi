The entire film is a single continuous shot, and there is no audio.[3][4] It receives its title from the expression "like watching paint dry",[5] which refers to something very tedious or boring.[6]
 
In protest against the BBFC's per-minute rate for film classifications, Shackleton stated that the average cost of an age classification for independent filmmakers could exceed 1,000, which would prove to be a heavy financial burden on most independent filmmakers.[8] According to Shackleton, the BBFC certificate for his debut self-distributed film, *Beyond Clueless*, cost 867.60, which was roughly fifty per cent of its distribution budget. Shackleton stated that he knew of several planned cinematic releases from independent filmmakers that had to be abandoned because the cost was too high, which he added was "terrible for British film culture".[10] He conceived the idea to make a film about paint drying while at a filmmaker's event at the BBFC in 2015.[13] He had expected to see conflict between the BBFC examiners and the visiting filmmakers, but was surprised that there was no such disagreement; Shackleton added that, on the contrary, many of the attending filmmakers seemed to be supportive of the BBFC.[14] He also disapproved of the examiners who were discussing the censorship of certain films and the rationale behind such action.[13]

The campaign also received donations from people outside of the UK, which surprised Shackleton as he thought that non-British individuals would be confused about the BBFC's authority. He concluded that censorship was unfortunately a "pretty universal concept".[22] Shackleton also stated that filmmakers from around the world, particularly Australia and India, were supportive of *Paint Drying*.[10] Despite suggestions from backers for Shackleton to secretly insert a penis into a single frame of *Paint Drying*, he ultimately decided against it as he believed it would have detracted from the point of the film.[13]
 
The Digital Cinema Package that Shackleton submitted to the BBFC for classification was 310 gigabytes in size.[23] Due to the length of the film, BBFC examiners split their viewing into two sessions over two consecutive days, the majority being viewed on 25 January.[24] To coincide with the examination, Shackleton held an 'Ask Me Anything' (AMA) question and answer session on the subreddit r/IAmA, during which he stated that he did not himself watch the film in its entirety.[21] Shackleton's post received hundreds of comments within a day and became top post on the subreddit on that day.[25] On 26 January, upon reviewing the film, the BBFC rated it 'U' for 'Universal,' indicating "no material likely to offend or harm".[2][4][26] After receiving a digital copy of the certificate, Shackleton tweeted that it was "5,936 well spent".[27]
 
Although the film likely did not have any influence on the BBFC's governing, the novel idea of the film and arguments raised by Shackleton have since been frequently discussed in the context of film censorship and classification.[30][31] After the film was first classified by the BBFC, *the A.V. Club* said that a "14-hour director's cut is presumably forthcoming",[32] and *Gizmodo AU* stated that uploading the film onto YouTube would be an ideal place for its "cinematic brilliance" to be permanently available for anyone to view.[23] British magazine *Dazed* said that if Shackleton had allowed *Paint Drying* to be shown in cinemas, it would have been a great way to prank one's significant other on Valentine's Day.[13] In the September 2016 issue of *Alive*, D.P. Sabharwal called the film "a novel and innovative protest".[33] In an April 2017 opinion piece by *National Post* praising Shackleton's work, Calum Marsh declared *Paint Drying* a comedy and praised Shackleton's dedication to creating the film. Marsh stated that he was unsure about its merit as a film, but stated that as a comedy, "it's very, very good".[34]
 
On 1 March 2016, *Paint Drying* was the subject of a video essay by the French series *Blow Up [fr]*, broadcast by Arte. In it, presenter Luc Lagier positively compares the film to *Wavelength* (1967), a structural film that consists of a gradually zooming-in shot of a room.[35] Shackleton reflected on *Paint Drying* in an article he wrote for *Vice* in April 2017, in which he stated that the BBFC remained unchanged since his protest, and "continues to ban films outright".[36] On 15 October 2018, *Paint Drying* was featured in an episode of series P of the British panel show *QI*.[37] In 2022, academic Arina Pismenny referred to *Paint Drying* as an example of art that was objectively boring yet interesting given its context.[38]
