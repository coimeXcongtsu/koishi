They discover even more paintings of them in past events that happened. One painting that Darwin discovers shows Gumball completely naked (except for a leaf) in the middle of an angry crowd at the mall. When Gumball says that he was never in that situation, Anais points out that the paintings will all happen and that the painting takes place today. Gumball is unnerved by this. After this, Richard accidentally knocks Banana Bob out while trying to pay for a pair of binoculars.

Back at home, Anais tells Gumball that he can change the future. After belittling his sister's advice, he takes it and does nothing in his room to avoid being naked at the mall. After barely a minute, Gumball's body begins to move on its own and goes downstairs. He explains that he has too much energy. Gumball grabs a pan and asks Darwin to knock him out. Darwin grabs the pan reluctantly and hits Gumball softly. When Darwin is asked to hit harder, he does so but fails to knock Gumball out. He hits harder again, but Gumball still does not go unconscious because of his "massive, clinically oversized, monumental" head (as said by Anais). When Gumball says that it does not matter as long as he does not go to the mall, Nicole is reminded and says he needs new clothes. Then she glares at Gumball with her fiery eyes when he insists on refusing.
 
Before Nicole reaches the car, Gumball sabotages the car. But when Nicole starts up the car with ease, she remarks that it seems more powerful than before. Then she speeds up to the mall, faster than before. While on the way, the radio and a sign on the road remind Gumball about the future. He then tries to escape the car only to find that they have already arrived at the mall. Taking advice from Anais again, he tries to ask his mom to not go to the mall "for the sake of mother earth" and to buy somewhere else. Then he tells Nicole about the painting after she sees through his act. Of course, Nicole does not believe this but proceeds to drive home. Before the car gets moving, the engine launches away and she goes to a car dealer in the mall. She takes her children with her, much to Gumball's dismay.
 
Gumball attempts many times to stop going to the mall, first by pretending to tie his shoelaces, then calling the police. These attempts are thwarted when Gumball ties his toes together instead, and the sheriff sees him making the hoax call. When the sheriff goes after him, Gumball creates a diversion by attracting crowds after claiming there will be a prize for the millionth shopper at the mall. This brings Gumball and his siblings into the mall, and Anais reminds him to not do anything at all. Gumball panics, and accidentally breaks the air conditioner of the mall. When it gets hot, Darwin unintentionally pours hot coffee on Gumball. Darwin inhales Gumball to try and get the hot air away from him but faints from too much inhaling. Then angry customers learn from Larry that there is no promo, and they see Gumball. Gumball braces himself and decides to deal with destiny. Then the events of the painting begin to form (an angry crowd, and angry police as well as the unconscious Darwin, and the presence of the recorders that will be recording his incident).
 
After the last event of the painting (raining raccoons) comes true, Gumball rips his remaining clothes off as the crowds and the police come to him. Just as he rips off his undergarments and trousers, Anais puts a leaf person on him and the moment (exactly like Banana Barbara's painting) is pictured and airs on national television. Back at home, Gumball grieves over this, and Anais comes to question "would any of [the events] have happened if [they] had not seen the painting?"

I love the gumball machine!! Also, wondering if the polka dots on the wall are from Land of Nod? Looking to do a wall of polka dots in our nursery and trying to decide if I should paint them or use the stickers! Thanks!!
 
For some reason every time I watch a season 1 episode and compare it to the recent seasons, gumball in my opinion is less mischievous and mean In the first season.....season 2 and up gumball is full blast mischievous and mean spirited most of the time.
 
Season 2 and Season 3 (episodes 1-19): Gumball has grown a lot more mature than Season 1 Gumball, but is still able to get jealous very quickly, can still over react, and for some episodes like The Hero he is an outright out of character jerk. Even though so he has shown to have a lot more logic than other classmates, like in The Sweaters where literally Gumball and Darwin held complete sense while everything became a stereotype/clich like Penny becoming the Mary Sue.
 
Season 3 (The Shell onwards) and Season 4 (as of The Uploads): Gumball has most of what he had earlier, he can still get jealous, but not as easily now since there's not much to get jealous of, and he can over react like he did in The Romantic. Even though so, The Shell made Gumball expose Nicole's genes, which was his determination and compassion for Penny. Gumball also started gaining some of Nicole's physical traits as well, such as a quick reaction time and a much faster running speed. Also Gumball has started to get a lot more logical, and has even took a more smarter route than Anais like in The Pest where he took the peaceful route by just simply talking with Billy while Anais took the physical offensive route which was to physically hurt him.
 
Skunk is the main character of Skunk Fu! He is usually seen as a ten-year-old, but like all the ages of the characters, this is debatable. He is a common, male, black and white skunk who has a very large red nose. He was dropped into China by accident, being mistaken for a baby panda, yet he might have a bigger destiny then he thought. Skunk is a struggling Kung Fu student. He's friends with Young Autobot, Grievous, Bulkhead, & Brick and wanted to also learn Spinjitsu.
 
**Appearance:** White body, black and blue mane, black and red tail, bright green eyes. and a horn. You'll never see DJ Gumball without his yellow wristband on his left foreleg. It's his favourite accessory. He also wears his headphones around his neck most of the time, but takes them off occasionally.
 
**Cutie Mark:** Gumball's cutie mark is an arrow, which is his logo since he's a DJ. The way he got his cutie mark was from his great knowledge of music. He then decided to make some electronic music himself on his computer. This revealed Gumball's destiny of becoming the greatest DJ in Equestria.
 
**Personality:** Gumball is a hardcore fan of electronic music, and he had always dreamed of being Equestria's greatest DJ and EDM producer. He usually enjoys spending time making music on his computer for several hours straight and showing it off to everypony.

Gumball is very friendly and has a great sense of humour. He always gets along with his best friends. Gumball rarely ever judges anyone. He is open minded and respectful, and he also supports anyone who is in trouble, whether it's a friend or not. Gumball usually tries to act cool around everyone to gain popularity. He is laid-back most of the time, but during rave concerts and parties, he is the most hyperactive pony you'll see in the crowd.

His negative traits however, are that he easily gets bored and lazy. Gumball also tells lies sometimes to cover up anything bad. He is also extremely gullible, immediately thinking everything he hears, good or bad, is true.

Overall, DJ Gumball is a cool guy to hang out with and would love to be friends with anypony.
 
**Backstory:** This virtuoso grew up in Manehattan, He had a huge interest in music and decided to make some himself. DJ Gumball had the ambition of becoming the best DJ in Equestria, so he spent several hours working on his music. 

At the age of 13, Gumball received his cutie mark - an arrow. The arrow is a logo that he designed for himself. He finally got his arrow cutie mark when he showed everypony his first song. Ever since that day, he worked harder than ever do achieve his dream of becoming the best EDM producer in Equestria.
 
The **Gumball Guardians** (also known as **Guardians of the Royal Promise**) are the primary protectors of the Candy Kingdom and the enforcers of the Royal Promise. The guardians make their first appearance in the episode "Slumber Party Panic." They also can be seen blowing bubbles on the walls of the Candy Kingdom in the opening sequence and many other episodes.
 
The guardians are robots that resemble gumball machines, due to their spherical glass heads and the colorful gumballs inside them. They have pink bodies and wear an ice cream cone hat. They are tall enough to easily step over the walls of the Candy Kingdom.
 
The Gumball Guardians, when fighting, seem to focus only on defeating the target. However, when dormant, they are docile and almost childlike, blowing bubbles from atop the walls of the Candy Kingdom. Additionally, they have a seemingly maternal relationship with Princess Bubblegum, referring to her as "mom" and "mother".
 
The Gumball Guardians were designed and built by Princess Bubblegum to protect the citizens of the Candy Kingdom. They became operational during the time while the kingdom was still und
