10 servos driving the action of 10 parts in the facemask.
Single powerbank drives everything and can be recharged while still inside, no batteries needed.
2 power switches, one for Arduino, one for Servos.
Trigger is located in the chin.
Wire management.
 
FAQ:
Can I scale this helmet?
No, nope, not a chance.
How big is this helmet? Will it fit my head?
There is a "cage" you can print to test for fit.
Can I see through the eyes?
Yes, but not in the dark.
Can I dim the eyes down?
Not in this version, maybe in the future.
Why do all the servos buzz when the helmet is open?
9g servos are not strong enough to keep everything open without power. Keeping the power to servos creates buzz.
How long does one charge last?
Not sure, but it is in the hours, not in minutes.
How long will it take to print everything?
Depends on your printer and nozzle size. On my Ender 5 with a 0.6mm nozzle, total print time is about 48 hours.
How much filament do I need?
1kg roll should cover it all.

The Steelers logo is based on the Steelmark logo belonging to the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). Created by the United States Steel Corporation (also referred to as U. S. Steel), the logo contains three hypocycloids (diamond shapes). The three hypocycloids mean: steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure and widens your world. They also represent the three materials used to produce steel: yellow for coal, orange for iron ore and blue for steel scrap.
 
When the Steelmark logo was created, U. S. Steel attached the following meaning to it: Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure and widens your world. The logo was used as part of a major marketing campaign to educate consumers about how important steel is in our daily lives. The Steelmark logo was used in print, radio and television ads as well as on labels for all steel products, from steel tanks to tricycles to filing cabinets.
 
**Power armour** is an advanced form of powered combat armour, worn primarily by the Space Marines and the Chaos Space Marines, though suits have been created to be worn by mere mortals. It is a completely enclosed suit of combat armour composed of shaped adamantium and plasteel plates, encased in a ceramite ablative layer.
 
Each suit possesses a full suite of life-support functions for operation in hostile environments, an automated *medicae* system to provide some level of first aid to a wounded wearer and a highly advanced and fully integrated tactical targeting and threat analysis system known as "auto-senses."
 
The suit would be heavy and cumbersome to wear but for the electrically-motivated fibre bundles within the armour that replicates the wearer's movement and enhances their strength beyond its already considerable superhuman baseline (for Space Marines).
 
Rather than simply being worn, a Space Marine's armour integrates with him. It can take many solar decades to forge a single suit of power armour, and each is maintained with absolute care and devotion by skilled Chapter serfs or even the Space Marines themselves. Each suit is a unique artefact with a spirit and history deeply valued by its Chapter.
 
Power armour has a range of auxiliary systems that improve the Space Marine's effectiveness, including auto-senses made up of thought-activated communications systems, augurs, audio filters, targeting reticules and numerous other features.
 
Life support functions include pain suppressors, combat stimulants and anti-venoms. Reinforced greaves incorporate gyroscopic stabilisers and power units that magnetise the soles of the armour's boots for zero-gravity and vacuum combat.
 
Primaris Space Marines now wear modular Mark X Power Armour. This highly flexible protective system can be modified and upgraded to suit the needs of the battlefield. Mark X Tacticus Power Armour is the most common Mark X variant, and is worn by Intercessors, among others.
 
Mark X Phobos Power Armour is lighter and heavily streamlined. With greater mobility and servo-motors engineered to be silent, it is used most optimally in stealth and infiltration missions, often by Reivers and Vanguard Space Marines.
 
Typically, however, these armours may not contain the same strength-enhancing properties or life-support functions of Space Marine power armour, nor do they always provide the same level of protection or mobility.
 
The enclosing suits of armour worn by Space Marines are made from thick ceramite plates and would be cumbersome but for electrically motivated fibre bundles that replicate the movements of the wearer and supplement his strength.
 
These plug-in points mesh with Space Marine power armour, linking the wearer's nervous system to his suit's mind impulse controls, turning the suit into a second skin that moves with all the speed and precision of the battle-brother's own body.
 
There are several patterns (or "marks") of power armour, whose appearances differ significantly. Many older marks have special associations for certain Chapters and are often worn by their ceremonial honour guards or elite units.
 
Power armour is maintained by skilled Artificers who are not Space Marines, but normal Human servants who spend their lives working for the Chapter. Especially talented Artificers are justly celebrated, and examples of their work highly prized.
 
Elements of ancient armour are religiously hunted down, for they carry both the history of the Chapter and the deeds of heroic individuals. Such pieces are lovingly restored and painstakingly engraved with new designs.
 
Power armour is fully sealed, isolating the wearer from the outside environment and protecting him from chemical and/or biological weapons and toxic atmospheres. It also commonly includes numerous auxiliary systems such as radio frequency communicators, auto-senses, etc.
 
Space Marines go through an arduous process where they receive various biogenetically-engineered implants culminating with the implantation of the Black Carapace which allows the Astartes a direct and instinctual neural interface with his power armour, transforming it into effectively a second skin.
 
The advanced systems of Space Marine power armour also monitor the Astartes' biological functions, feeding the collected medical information to the wearer and, if necessary, to the Chapter's Apothecaries when he is wounded.
 
Power armour has been in use since before the Age of the Imperium, worn by the techno-barbarians that dominated Terra during the Age of Strife. It was also worn by the early genetically-engineered warriors that formed part of the Emperor's retinue during his unification of Terra towards the end of the Age of Strife in the 30th Millennium.
 
In the armour's earliest incarnation, the suit was not fully sealed or life-supporting, this being unnecessary while its use was still confined solely to Terra. Over the history of the Imperium, power armour has developed into many different forms. Need, circumstances and the recovery of new materials and lost advanced technology, so-called archeotech, has shaped the armour's evolution.
 
The common image of the Emperor's Space Marines is of mighty warriors arrayed in imposing suits of armour made of ceramite plates, adorned with a bold two-headed Aquila on their chests. This pattern of power armour, dubbed the "Aquila Pattern," is the one most often seen among the Firstborn Space Marines, but is in fact just one of eight distinct "marks" seen on battlefields over the millennia.
 
All the recent types are still in active use, to varying degrees, by the existing Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes. Working examples of the older marks, meanwhile, are extremely rare and valued as a physical link to the glorious history of the Sp
