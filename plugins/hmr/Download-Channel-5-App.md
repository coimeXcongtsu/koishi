Chrome supports a number of different release channels. We use these channels toslowly roll out updates to users, starting with our close to daily Canarychannel builds, all the way up to our Stable channel releases that happen every6 weeks roughly.
 
The release channels for chrome range from the most stable and tested (Stablechannel) to completely untested and likely least stable (Canary channel). Youcan run all channels alongside all others, as they do not share profiles withone another. This allows you to play with our latest code, while still keeping atested version of Chrome around.
 
**Note**: Early access releases (Canary builds and Dev and Beta channels) willbe only partly translated into languages other than English. Text related to newfeatures may not get translated into all languages until the feature is releasedin the Stable channel.
 
Before you switch, you should make a backup of your profile (bookmarks, mostvisited pages, history, cookies, etc). If you ever want to switch back to a morestable channel, your updated profile data might not be compatible with the olderversion.Make a copy of the User Data\Default directory (for example, copy it to'Default Backup' in the same location). The location depends on your operatingsystem:
 
The **English Channel**,[a][1] also known as **the Channel**, is an arm of the Atlantic Ocean that separates Southern England from northern France. It links to the southern part of the North Sea by the Strait of Dover at its northeastern end. It is the busiest shipping area in the world.[2]
 
The name first appears in Roman sources as Oceanus Britannicus (or Mare Britannicum, meaning the British Ocean or British Sea). Variations of this term were used by influential writers such as Ptolemy, and remained popular with British and continental authors well into the modern era. Other Latin names for the sea include Oceanus Gallicus (the Gaulish Ocean) which was used by Isidore of Seville in the sixth century.[6]
 
The term *British Sea* is still used by speakers of Cornish and Breton, with the sea known to them as Mor Bretannek and Mor Breizh respectively. While it is likely that these names derive from the Latin term, it is possible that they predate the arrival of the Romans in the area. The modern Welsh is often given as Mr Udd (the Lord's or Prince's Sea); however, this name originally described both the Channel and the North Sea combined.[7][8]
 
Anglo-Saxon texts make reference to the sea as Sū-sǣ (South Sea), but this term fell out of favour, as later English authors followed the same conventions as their Latin and Norman contemporaries. One English name that did persist was the *Narrow Seas*, a collective term for the channel and North Sea. As England (followed by Great Britain and the United Kingdom) claimed sovereignty over the sea, a Royal Navy Admiral was appointed with maintaining duties in the two seas. The office was maintained until 1822, when several European nations (including the United Kingdom) adopted a three-mile (4.8 km) limit to territorial waters.[1]
 
The word *channel* was first recorded in Middle English in the 13th century and was borrowed from the Old French word chanel (a variant form of chenel 'canal'). By the middle of the fifteenth century, an Italian map based on Ptolemy's description named the sea as *Britanicus Oceanus nunc Canalites Anglie* (British Ocean but now English Channel). The map is possibly the first recorded use of the term *English Channel* and the description suggests the name had recently been adopted.[9]
 
In the sixteenth century, Dutch maps referred to the sea as the Engelse Kanaal (English Channel) and by the 1590s, William Shakespeare used the word *Channel* in his history plays of Henry VI, suggesting that by that time, the name was popularly understood by English people.[10]
 
By the eighteenth century, the name *English Channel* was in common usage in England. Following the Acts of Union 1707, this was replaced in official maps and documents with *British Channel* or *British Sea* for much of the next century. However, the term English Channel remained popular and was finally in official usage by the nineteenth century.[11]
 
The French name la Manche has been used since at least the 17th century.[4] The name is usually said to refer to the sleeve (French: la manche) shape of the Channel. Folk etymology has derived it from a Celtic word meaning 'channel' that is also the source of the name for the Minch in Scotland,[12] but this name is not attested before the 17th century, and French and British sources of that time are clear about its etymology.[13] The name in French has been directly adapted in other languages as either a calque, such as Canale della Manica in Italian, or a direct borrowing, such as Canal de la Mancha in Spanish.
 
The Strait of Dover (French: Pas de Calais), at the Channel's eastern end, is its narrowest point, while its widest point lies between Lyme Bay and the Gulf of Saint Malo, near its midpoint.[3] Well on the continental shelf, it has an average depth of about 120 m (390 ft) at its widest; yet averages about 45 m (148 ft) between Dover and Calais, its notable sandbank hazard being Goodwin Sands. Eastwards from there the adjoining North Sea reduces to about 26 m (85 ft) across the Broad Fourteens (14 fathoms) where it lies over the southern cusp of the former land bridge between East Anglia and the Low Countries. The North Sea reaches much greater depths east of northern Britain. The Channel descends briefly to 180 m (590 ft) in the submerged valley of Hurd's Deep, 48 km (30 mi) west-northwest of Guernsey.[15]
 
There are several major islands in the Channel, the most notable being the Isle of Wight off the English coast, and the Channel Islands, British Crown Dependencies off the coast of France. The coastline, particularly on the French shore, is deeply indented, with several small islands close to the coastline, including Chausey and Mont-Saint-Michel. The Cotentin Peninsula on the French coast juts out into the Channel, with the wide Bay of the Seine (French: Baie de Seine) to its east. On the English side there is a small parallel strait, the Solent, between the Isle of Wight and the mainland. The Celtic Sea is to the west of the Channel.
 
The Channel acts as a funnel that amplifies the tidal range from less than a metre at sea in eastern places to more than 6 metres in the Channel Islands, the west coast of the Cotentin Peninsula and the north coast of Brittany in monthly spring tides. The time difference of about six hours between high water at the eastern and western limits of the Channel is indicative of the tidal range being amplified further by resonance.[16] Amphidromic points are the Bay of Biscay and varying more in precise location in the far south of the North Sea, meaning both those associated eastern coasts repel the tides effectively, leaving the Strait of Dover as every six hours the natural bottleneck short of its consequent gravity-induced repulsion of the southward tide (surge) of the North Sea (equally from the Atlantic). The Channel does not experience, but its existence is necessary to explain the extent of North Sea storm surges, such as necessitate the Thames Barrier, Delta Works, Zuiderzee works (Afsluitdijk and other dams).
 
The first flood of 450,000 years ago would have lasted for several months, releasing as much as one million cubic metres of water per second.[19][20] The flood started with large but localised waterfalls over the ridge, which excavated depressions now known as the *Fosses Dangeard*. The flow eroded the retaining ridge, causing the rock dam to fail and releasing lake water int
