A save editor is a software tool that allows you to modify every aspect of your game save files without losing any data. The online save editor is the ultimate tool for customizing your favorite games. With support for popular formats like Ren'Py, RPG Maker MV/MZ/VX/XP, NaniNovel, and JSON, our editor is compatible with a wide range of games. Save Editor ensures that you never lose any data and makes it easy to make changes to your game saves.
 
With a powerful search feature, you can quickly find the values you need to customize. SaveEditor.online gives you complete control over your gaming experience and unlocks new possibilities. Try it out today and start taking your gaming to the next level!
 
The save editor prioritizes safety and security and is designed to make modifying your game saves as safe as possible. However, it's always a good idea to make a backup of your original save file before using the editor, just in case something goes wrong. This will ensure that you can revert to your original save file if any issues arise.
 
Our editor is designed to be non-destructive, meaning that it won't affect your original game or save files. Instead, our tool creates a copy of the original save file and makes changes to that copy. This way, you can make changes to your game saves without the risk of data loss or corruption.
 
While using our save editor, you should also be careful not to modify any fields that you're unsure about. Some game saves have complex structures and interdependencies, and modifying the wrong field could cause issues with your game. However, with Save Editor's user-friendly interface and powerful search feature, you can quickly and easily find and modify the fields you need to customize.
 
In summary, while SaveEditor.online is designed to be safe and secure, it's always a good idea to make a backup of your original save file before using the editor. With our non-destructive editing and powerful search features, you can safely and easily customize your game saves to your liking.

You can edit anything from in-game resources like money, level, and progress to various game settings. Our tool allows you to view and change all the information you need without removing any data. However, we recommend creating a backup before making any changes to avoid losing progress. Try it out today and take control of your gaming experience!
 
Our search feature is designed to be both powerful and versatile, providing you with the ability to efficiently locate any value or variable in your save file. With multiple search modes and filters, you can easily find the information you need to customize your gaming experience. Here's an overview of what our search function offers:
 
For a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to make the most of our search feature, please refer to our comprehensive instruction. This guide will help you utilize our search functionality effectively and customize your gaming experience like never before.
 
We understand that having the ability to undo changes made to your game save files is an important feature for a better user experience. Currently, our editor does not have a built-in undo feature. However, we offer a "Show only changed fields" checkbox that allows you to filter and see all of the changes you've made to your save file.
 
By using this feature, you can observe all of the changes you've made and manually reset any fields back to their original values. While this may not be as convenient as an undo feature, it can still be a helpful way to revert any unwanted changes.
 
We want to assure you that we are actively working on adding an undo feature to our editor in the near future. We are committed to providing the best possible user experience, and we understand the importance of having this feature for our users. In the meantime, we recommend that you use the "Show only changed fields" checkbox to help you keep track of your changes and make it easier to manually reset any fields if needed.
 
What would be quite nice would be an enemy editor. Even if it just resumes to moves editing, sprite switching, and palette editing; it would be quite nice. We could port enemies from EB and all nice stuff like that.
 
My packrat-ness is getting to me, and I currently have 3 characters with banks just for storing items (one for purples, one for uniques, one for legendaries). What I'd really love to do is haxxor my Bank on one of those characters to be far larger. Gibbed's save editor seems to have potential but I don't see a specific option for this. I do however see a "raw" tab to edit specific data...but I also don't see any obvious way to do this.
 
The easiest, and only way that I know of is to use Gibbed to overstuff the bank with any bankable item, and then swap it out with what you want to keep (You must swap or you will lose the space). I think the max is 42 slots.
 
You can also do this with your backpack, but its more trouble than it is worth unless you never want to trade with others or purchase from machines. I tried adding slots via the raw tab multiple times but they never stay after removing an item from the bank. The slot was just gone. The game must overwrite the added slots unless there is something in them.
 
Another thing you can do is retrieve the item code via Gibbed and save it to a text file (or word doc for example and accompany with screenshots or brief description). You can then reimport the item if you want/need it. It isn't often you need 42 different items in your current inventory so backing up the item codes is often enough.
 
So i used the time between exams and the new semester, and now a significant time into said semester, to give a crack at making an FE9 randomizer. What i ended up with was a Character Editor/Randomizer for Windows.
 
I added a fixing case for updating to v1.1 without re-randomizing: Open the new version of the editor, go to Illyana, press apply, set the enemy growth to 0, then save and quit. That should fix everything up, except Illyana past her recruitment. You are then free to open the editor back up to (now for real) re-apply the enemy growth increase. You can then re-build the iso with the fixes, it will work with the old save.
 
I have been playing AoM multiplayer with some friends (still only midway through vanilla game), enjoyed it so much that I decided to buy and install Forgotten Gods. I loaded up my character, hosted a game and they can no longer join due to not owning Forgotten Gods.
 
It seems ridiculous that all I did was host a game with a character, not do any quests or pick up anything, not even move, and yet that character is broken so I can no longer play it with my friends - short of them also buying the Forgotten Gods DLC.
 
The game made a backup of your char, which you can use without FG. The name of this backup starts with two underscores instead of one before the character name. If you do not have custom paths you find your local files at one of these locations:
 
[/INDENT]
Move the FG save game folder to a different location. You can remove one of the underscores of the remaining folder, but I believe this step is not required. Any progress you made with this char in FG is of course lost, but I understand there has not been any.
 
I've tried this extension: -save-editor-layout -- but it's broken for me and reports every tab I try to save as a 'temporary unsaved tab' that cannot be saved. I guess I could never close my editor, but I'd rather not. I've been thinking of some way to automate the resizing/splitting of my tabs but was wondering if there's an easier way I missed?
 
Also as a side question are there any 'good' linux tutorial sites, I seem to trawl for hours trying to find the simplest answers? 'Good' as in explained well and without omitting vital info (like which gui you are using).
 
The tutorial you saw was telling you how to exit nano editor. By typing Ctrl+X nano exits and if your file needs change you will be prompted to save the changes in which case to save you should press Y and then enter to save changes in the same file you open.
 
Regarding tutorial, The Linux Documentation Project would be a good place to start.If you like books I would recommend by far any book you want from O'Reilly. They have nice cd bookshelfs with good compilation for any linux sysadmin, and without much effort you can find many places where those html bookshelfs are available to read online.
 
Currently (as far as I know) only supports US save files, from game cartidges, emulators, or the 3DS VC re-releases. If someone can link me to documentation of the JP save offsets, I'd be happy to add support for JP games.
 
This came about from my implementing Gen I pokemon reading (so that PKHeX will be able to easily convert from Gen I -> Gen VII when Sun/Moon release), and when I realized that the current Gen I save editors have pretty bad UIs.
 
Our current save editors didn't have the best UIs yeah, but also I've heard that a lot of them didn't always work well and would tend to cause corruption. If this one works (close to) perfectly, that'll be great.
 
I think the problem is more related to OT/NICKNAME having only 5 chars + terminator and the japanesse games having different amount of pokemon in each box (and different amount of boxes) than locating the offsets.
 
Also, what's the pk1 format structure? I'm asking mostly because even though thi
