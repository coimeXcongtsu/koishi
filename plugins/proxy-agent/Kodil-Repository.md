Kodi Addons and builds offer unlimited streaming content, but could also get you into legal trouble if caught streaming free movies, TV shows, or sports. **Currently, your IP is visible to everyone**. Kodi users are strongly advised to always connect to a VPN while streaming online. A good Kodi VPN hides your identity, bypasses government surveillance, geo-blocked content, and ISP throttling (which also helps in buffer-free streaming).
 
**Note:** This path is for the EzzerMacs repository. If you are installing any other repo, use the appropriate link for that repo. I have provided the source links along with the description of each repository.

From the Program Add-ons section, you can install the EzzerMac Wizard, which is the source of dozens of EzzerMac Kodi Builds. You can also get the SG Wizard addon from here. You will also find plenty of utility and maintenance addons for Kodi.
 
This is another Kodi addon with a few video addons you need on your device. It is compatible with Kodi 21 and 20, and the developers actively manage the repository. This means any hardware issues or bugs are fixed as soon as users raise them.
 
If you are more into Live TV, South Paw Repository is the one you need! You have everything from radio, movies, and TV shows to Live TV in this repository. You can access a wide range of add-ons from music add-ons (TuneIn Radio), program add-ons, and video add-ons.
 
Thankfully, there is a foolproof way to keep all your streaming activities **hidden** from your ISP and the Government. All you need is a good VPN for Kodi. A VPN will mask your original IP which is  and will help you bypass Online Surveillance, ISP throttling, and content geo-restrictions.
 
**NOTE:** We **do not** encourage the violation of copyright laws. But, what if you end up streaming content from an illegitimate source unintentionally? It is not always easy to tell the difference between a legit and illegal source.

Diamond Wizard Repo, from the top of my list, is probably the best replacement repository for Kodil. More than just a repository for storing Diamond builds, the newly developed Diamond Wizard Repository can also serve as a perfect place for installing addons for movie, TV shows, IPTV, sports and live channels. Here you can find sensational addons like The Magic Dragon, 7 of 9 (AIO), Delta Quadrant, Beta Quadrant, Alpha Quadrant, USS Defiant and many more.
 
Given Kodil repo shutting down and Elysium addon going offline, Kodil users may have a lack of solutions in streaming live content. And Ghost Repository come to the rescue.

Similar to Diamond Wizard Repository, EzzerMacs Wizard Repository was first developed as a container for their exclusive builds and other essential program addons, and has since become a best Kodi repository to download video addons. In EzzerMac Wizard Repo, you can see a long list of addons that serve for different purposes we desperately needed. Here's medusa, TubiTV addon, Kratos Reborn and Athena for movies & TV shows; Allvue TV, Beam IPTV and Arconai TV for IPTV and VOD; and Luxray Prime & Luxray Video for all-in-one streams.
 
Developed by Kodibae, Kodi Bae was a fairly popular addon back and well enjoyed by an ocean of users until it got many featured addons removed due to legal pressures. Though left only 14 addons, Kodi Bae Repository is still a go-to repo for Kodi users since it provides a selection of must-have addons: cCloud TV, Hummingbird, Release BB, Seren, Sportowa TV, WatchNixtoons 2, etc. Kodi Bae Repo doesn't have many addons for major categories, but it does offer the bests of each kind.
 
The aforementioned repositories are all working, well-tested and trusted by the community, I hope this post can help you in making repo installation decisions after Kodil shutting down. Looking for more repo options? Check out our Best Kodi Repositories List to explore 20+ worthy repositories.
 
Since we know that KODI is a media player which is capable of streaming media content from both offline and online location. In order to stream content from online, you need the help of some additional programs called add-ons. There are two types of kodi addons. One is the official add-ons and the other is 3rd party add-ons. Add-ons are script files for screaming remote contents. And to install them to kodi, you need the help of kodi repositories. In other words, to install these add-ons we first need to install the kodi repositories. These kodi repos will contain the dependencies files required for the proper functioning of add-ons. In this article, we will explain what is kodi repository and a list of **best Kodi repositories**.
 
Kodi Repositories act as a space to store common files and they are accessed by add-ons. For the proper functioning of add-ons, a lot of files are required. These support files are called dependencies. Some of the most used dependencies are scrapper and URL Resolver. When developing an addon, the developers use call by function method to call these dependencies files into action. Since some of these files have copyright protection, the developers can only use them. they can modify or change stuff. These files are available in the repository. And when calling for a certain function, the corresponding function will respond from the repository.
 
Some developers may have their own kodi repositories while some may not. Since most of these files are open source, some developers are skilled enough to change the base code and host it in their own repository. One such repository is Blamo Repository. He is the co-developer of URL Resolver and Exodus.
 
In install from zip file method, we will download the required files on our local hardware. And during installation, we will redirect to the installer stored location. Whereas in another method we will directly enter the path in the installer and during installation, the installer will download the required files.
 
The Superrepo is one of the best kodi repositories which has lots of sub-repository due to its vast collections of diverse add-ons. It is the host for most of the evergreen addons. Super repo is the most reliable repository. Super repos have 1700+ addons. In that 1000+ addons are video addons. And it is the largest of all repository. Due to the large size of the repository, they have even provided part installation of the repository. Which means you can install the required part alone. If you are looking for video addons, then you can select the version of kodi you are using followed by the section you want to install.
 
Wondering how Kodi and SuperRepo work together? As Kodi is an operational system, many users like to customize it to add new operations. This is where the repository SuperRepo comes into play. When we use Kodi and SuperRepo together, they create a high-end entertaining hub that is customizable to the users. Further, the super repository has more than 500 repositories linked to it. You can find the linked repository under addon repository section. Follow the below guide to install the latest version of the super repository.
 
TV Addons repo is back with the bang! with much-improved feature and with lots of new addons. Due to the copyright infringement, TV addons repo recently faced some issues. And once the charges are cleared, TV addons is back. It has some of the coolest features ever like GitHub Browser. Since GitHub is the host to a lot of third-party addons, GitHub browser enables you to search for the addons by the developer username and let you install it. This method is similar to the zip file installation method. TV Addons is one of the three founding fathers of URL Resolver. The quality of the addons available in this repository is awesome!
 
In case, if your TV addon repo is not wor
