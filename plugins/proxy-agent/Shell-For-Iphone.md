Sure. You need to jailbreak it and install MobileTerminal (an application you'll find in Cydia for installation, once having jailbroken your iPhone).
MobileTerminal gives you access to the iPhones bash (shell).

To write decent shell scripts you would also need to install some shell utilities that you would expect to be there by default like vi, curl, openssh, ...
All of this is available in Cydia as well.

If you mean that you want to run shell commands on the iphone itself, you won't be able to do that without jailbreaking it first. Once jailbroken, there are many tools available for all kinds of "hacking".
 
Each BookBook is designed specifically for the iPhone models listed next to it. While the dimensions may appear the same, differences in the button positioning and camera size ensure the best compatibility.
 
Your wallet and iPhone go pretty much everywhere you go. BookBook holds both in the form of a mini leather book. Your bank cards, ID and cash are conveniently held on one side, with iPhone on the other side. A camera cutout lets you easily snap photos and video. BookBook has a built-in viewing stand to FaceTime or view your favorite shows. If you think about it, BookBook for iPhone will become the storybook of your life.

Behind the vintage look of BookBook is the story of protecting modern technology. BookBook has a 30 millimeter magnetic tab that keeps the case closed, protecting your phone and contents of your wallet. Hardback book covers and a rigid spine protect your iPhone from scratches and impacts. The final chapter is stealthy security. BookBook disguises your iPhone as a vintage leather-bound book, keeping your phone out of sight, even in plain sight.
 
Yes, the BookBook shell for iPhone 12, 12 Pro, 12 mini, and 12 Pro Max have been updated to include MagSafe compatibility.Have a previous version of BookBook for iPhone 12? Great news - you can upgrade it! Learn more here.
 
The window slot provides edge-to-edge protection, which has two benefits. It keeps the Apple Card stain-free, and it keeps the metal edges of the Apple Card away from your iPhone screen. Additionally, the window slot has a thumb-slide, allowing quick and easy access to your Apple Card.
 
Yes, you will still be able to use your BookBook as a hands-free stand. Note, however, that when the BookBook is new, the crease in the back cover is stiff, so for the first few times, you will need to bend the cover along that crease to loosen it up to ensure the iPhone shell will stay attached to the back cover via the magnets.
 
I have had many of these. Phone size changes and an unfortunate roto-tiller accident have required me to purchase more as I age. I was at a "phone store" and I saw one some years ago. I told the sales clerk that I love the look but was concerned about the protection the case had for the phone itself. The salesman explained he had the very same one. He removed it from his pocket and threw it over his shoulder and 30' behind him. The protection example could be no more convincing than that. I purchased my first then and there and intend to remain a customer as long as you agree to make an excellent product.
 
This has a minimalistic git functionality based on the libgit library (GitHub - libgit2/libgit2: A cross-platform, linkable library implementation of Git that you can use in your application.) through a lg2 command line.
 
Yes a-shell does provide a shortcuts interface for running scripts so I think that should be doable. I Did some initial tests, and it does run git, but one needs to ensure all is scripted and no manual inputs etc.
 
hi, I used ssh-key with lg2 command. But it always asks password for lg2 pull or lg2 push. And I need to input empty just by entering enter. The ssh-key is sshkey-gen with emtpy password.
Do your have the same preblem? Thx.
 
Designed for all iPhones, select appropriate model from drop-down menu. Main phone compartment with single exterior card pocket. Cordovan is a rare, equine shell with a 6-month tanning process. Dense and nonporous, it is noted for its suppleness and durability. Some finishes may not be available for purchase. Material availability is limited.
 
One of the most common things you do when testing an app is accessing the device shell. In this section we'll see how to access the iOS shell both remotely from your host computer with/without a USB cable and locally from the device itself.
 
In contrast to Android where you can easily access the device shell using the adb tool, on iOS you only have the option to access the remote shell via SSH. This also means that your iOS device must be jailbroken in order to connect to its shell from your host computer. For this section we assume that you've properly jailbroken your device and have either Cydia (see screenshot below) or Sileo installed. In the rest of the guide we will reference to Cydia, but the same packages should be available in Sileo.
 
In order to enable SSH access to your iOS device you can install the OpenSSH package. Once installed, be sure to connect both devices to the same Wi-Fi network and take a note of the device IP address, which you can find in the **Settings -> Wi-Fi** menu and tapping once on the info icon of the network you're connected to.
 
Remember to change the default password for both users root and mobile as anyone on the same network can find the IP address of your device and connect via the well-known default password, which will give them root access to your device.
 
The above command maps port 22 on the iOS device to port 2222 on localhost. You can also make iproxy run automatically in the background if you don't want to run the binary every time you want to SSH over USB.
 
Small note on USB of an iDevice: on an iOS device you cannot make data connections anymore after 1 hour of being in a locked state, unless you unlock it again due to the USB Restricted Mode, which was introduced with iOS 11.4.1
 
While usually using an on-device shell (terminal emulator) might be very tedious compared to a remote shell, it can prove handy for debugging in case of, for example, network issues or check some configuration. For example, you can install NewTerm 2 via Cydia for this purpose (it supports iOS 6.0 to 12.1.2 at the time of this writing).
 
In addition, there are a few jailbreaks that explicitly disable incoming SSH for security reasons. In those cases, it is very convenient to have an on-device shell app, which you can use to first SSH out of the device with a reverse shell, and then connect from your host computer to it.
 
An application shell is the secret to reliably good performance. Think of your app's shell like the bundle of code you'd publish to an app store if you were building a native app. It's the load needed to get off the ground, but might not be the whole story. It keeps your UI local and pulls in content dynamically through an API.
 
Alex Russell's Progressive Web Apps article describes how a web app can progressively change through use and user consent to provide a more native-app-like experience complete with offline support, push notifications and the ability to be added to the home screen. It depends very much on the functionality and performance benefits of service worker and their caching abilities. This allows you to focus on **speed**, giving your web apps the same **instant loading** and regular updates you're used to seeing in native applications.
 
Let's dive into how to structure your app using a **service worker augmentedapplication shell architecture**. We'll look at both client and server-side rendering and share an end-to-end sample you can try today.
 
To emphasize the point, the example below shows the first load of an app using this architecture. Notice the 'App is ready for offline use' toast at the bottom of the screen. If an update to the shell becomes available later, we can inform the user to refresh for the new version.
 
A service worker is a script that runs in the background, separate from your web page. It responds to events, including network requests made from pages it serves and push notices from your server. A service worker has an intentionally short lifetime. It wakes up when it gets an event and runs only as long as it needs to process it.
 
A service worker can intercept network requests made from a page (which triggers a fetch event on the service worker) and return a response retrieved from the network, or retrieved from a local cache, or even constructed programmatically. Effectively, it's a programmable proxy in the browser. The neat part is that, regardless of where the response comes from, it looks to the web page as though there were no service worker involvement.
 
Service workers are powerful for offline caching but they also offer significant performance wins in the form of instant loading for repeat visits to your site or web app. You can cache your application shell so it works offline and populate its content using JavaScript.
 
On repeat visits, this allows you to get **meaningful pixels** on the screen without the network, even if your content eventually comes from there. Think of it as displaying toolbars and cards **immediately**, then loading the rest of your content **progressively**.
 
We can also test our sample with a slightly slower 3G connection. This time it takes **2.5 seconds** on first visit for our first meaningful paint. It takes **7.1 seconds** to fully load the page. With service worker caching, our repeat visit achieves meaningful paint and fully finishes loading in **0.8 seconds**.
 
Service workers imply some subtle changes in application architecture. Rather than squashing all of your application into an HTML string, it can be beneficial to do things AJAX-style. This is where you have a shell (that is always cached and can
