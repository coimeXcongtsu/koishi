The third season, consisting of 13 episodes, was taped at the South Point Casino at 9:00 p.m. and premiered on January 15, 2007, and ended on April 9, 2007. New players for the third season included Jamie Gold, Phil Ivey, Chris Ferguson, Patrik Antonius, Paul Wasicka, David Benyamine, Brian Townsend, and others. Returning players from previous seasons included Doyle Brunson, Daniel Negreanu, Sammy Farha, Phil Laak, Jennifer Harman, Barry Greenstein, Erick Lindgren, Mike Matusow, Brad Booth, and others.[4]
 
On April 2, 2007, GSN announced that *High Stakes Poker* would return for a fourth season, again taped at South Point. Taping was completed in May, with the season premiering on August 27, 2007 at 9:00 p.m. Returning players included Patrik Antonius, David Benyamine, Doyle Brunson, Eli Elezra, Sam Farha, Jamie Gold, Barry Greenstein, Phil Hellmuth Jr., Jennifer Harman, and Daniel Negreanu. Newcomers for the fourth season include Brandon Adams, Mike Baxter, Brian Brandon, Phil Galfond, Guy Lalibert, Bob Safai, Antonio Salorio, and Haralabos Voulgaris. The later episodes of this season featured a $500,000 minimum buy-in (compared to the regular $100,000 minimum) and these games saw more than $5 million in play on the table at one time. Season four finished airing on December 17, 2007, and featured 17 episodes. The network cited the show's strong ratings performance in younger demographics.[5]
 
Season five, consisting of 13 episodes, ran from March 1, 2009 to May 24, 2009 at 9:00 p.m., was taped at the Golden Nugget on December 19, 2008 to December 21, 2008, and featured a minimum cash buy-in of $200,000. The format for season five differed slightly from its predecessors by having Kaplan and Benza not appear on camera until after the first commercial break in the show rather than at the outset.[6]
 
Season six premiered at 8:00 p.m. on February 14, 2010, and ended on May 9, 2010, with Kaplan and Kara Scott.[7] It was taped for a second straight season at the Golden Nugget. The sixth season aired with three different groups of players throughout 13 episodes. Tom Dwan and Phil Ivey bought in for $500,000. Other rotating players, including newcomers Jason Mercier, Dennis Phillips, Andrew Robl, and Lex Veldhuis, bought in for $200,000.
 
Season seven debuted on its new GSN Saturday night time slot at 8:00 p.m. from February 26, 2011 to May 21, 2011.[8] Norm Macdonald replaced Kaplan as the host and Kara Scott conducted interviews from the poker room floor.[9] The season, consisting of 13 episodes, was filmed in December 2010 at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. Sponsored Full Tilt Poker pros were required to boycott the show this time around, as rival site PokerStars became its official sponsors. Thus, "High Stakes Poker" Season 7 is devoid of such Full Tilt pros as Phil Ivey, Jennifer Harman, Tom Dwan, Patrik Antonius, David Benyamine, Mike Matusow, and Eli Elezra. GSN later announced it would be scaling back its airings of *High Stakes Poker* after PokerStars pulled out of the U.S. market following the indictments in *United States v. Scheinberg et al.* crackdown on online gambling.[10]

Season eight ran for 14 episodes from December 16, 2020 to March 17, 2021 on the streaming service PokerGO. It was taped at the Aria Resort and Casino.[11] In October 2021, Vice TV began airing episodes from the PokerGO run.[12] Season nine ran from February 21, 2022 to May 23, 2022 for 14 episodes.[13] Season ten ran from January 24, 2023 to May 30, 2023 for 17 episodes.[14][15] The show aired a special live episode on April 27, 2023.[16] Season eleven ran from August 7, 2023 to November 20, 2023 for 14 episodes.[17] Season twelve ran from February 19, 2024 to May 13, 2024 for 12 episodes.[18]
 
The players include poker professionals along with amateurs such as Jerry Buss and Fred Chamanara. The show was created by executive producer Henry Orenstein. In season one, Daniel Negreanu confirmed in a post on his website's forums that all players were paid $1,250 per hour for taking part and that 13 episodes were edited down from 24 hours of actual play.[21] 2006 WSOP Main Event Champion Jamie Gold commented that players were paid for participating, though they had to put much more money at risk to get to play the game. Gold also spoke about his interactions with other players, particularly Mike Matusow.[22] The theme song for the show is titled "I'm All In", written and performed by John Pratt.[*citation needed*]
 
These players appeared in the first seven seasons: Doyle Brunson, Antonio Esfandiari, Barry Greenstein, and Daniel Negreanu.[26] None of them returned for the eighth season, while only Phil Hellmuth, Tom Dwan, Phil Ivey, and Brandon Adams appeared in both the original *High Stakes Poker*, and season 8.[27]
 
Most seasons included a key sponsor. Over the years, they included notable companies like PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker, and Bellagio. The eighth and ninth seasons were sponsored by Poker King, an online poker app focused on the Asian market. Season 10 was sponsored by PokerGO Hold'em, while Season 11 sponsors included StormX, True Classic, and Solve for Why.

Longtime poker fans will wax poetically about High Stakes Poker. The televised cash game known for massive stakes with some of the biggest names in poker holds a special place for most poker fans. Part of that lore comes with the longstanding presence of **Gabe Kaplan** as one of the commentators.
 
Kaplan worked alongside Benza for the first five seasons of High Stakes Poker when it ran on Game Show Network. He worked one season with Kara Scott before being replaced by Norm MacDonald for Season 7. Kaplan and Benza reunited in Season 8 when PokerGO assumed ownership of the show and made it a staple of their streaming content.
 
The Season 8 premiere, which drops on Wednesday, Dec. 16, will seat poker star Tom Dwan (pictured above), former Major League Baseball pitcher Michael Schwimer, Jean-Robert Bellande, Bryn Kenney, Rick Salomon and Nick Petrangelo for the high-stakes cash game.
 
PokerGO streams more than 100 days of live poker on an annual basis, including tournaments like the Super High Roller Bowl, Poker Masters and U.S. Poker Open, along with The World Series of Poker and WPT final tables. PokerGO is available on any web or mobile browser, or through the PokerGO app on any Apple device (iPhone, iPad and Apple TV), Android device (phone and tablet), Amazon device (Fire TV and Fire Stick) and Roku device.
 
The Season 11 premiere of High Stakes Poker brought an electrifying start with a spectacular Royal Flush sighting on the grandest HSP episode. If this initial installment serves as a preview for the upcoming season, poker enthusiasts are in for a truly captivating experience. 

 
The stakes soared to unprecedented heights in this episode, as all six players seated at the table were committed to a minimum of $500,000 each. Additionally, elevated straddle bets of $4,000 and beyond remained consistehroughout the session. Among the participants were a pair of regulars, Jean-Robert Bellande and Andrew Robl, joined by four other well-known faces: Rob Yong, Charles Yu, Rick Salomon, and Ferdinand Putra. 

 
Robl made a strategic move to augment his chip stack as the episode progressed, ultimately amassing over $1.6 million at a particular juncture. The game was punctuated by several colossal pots, including a remarkable occurrence where a top two pair collided with a Royal Flush.
