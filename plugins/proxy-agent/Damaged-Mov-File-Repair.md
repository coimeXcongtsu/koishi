They will need to put in a new circuit board and clean the insides. They claim it will be restored to "good working order". This is the first time I've had to deal with this situation so I'm wondering if the $700 fix has a good chance at being successful for a couple more years. I know Canon cannot guarantee anything but if repairing the camera has a good chance at restoring it to a similar quality as before the accident, I would rather spend $700 than $2,000, or whatever a new mkiii is going for. If anyone has any experience with this I would greatly appreciate any useful information! Thank you.
 
From my experience with Canon CPS, if Canon says they can fix it for $700 you can't buy another one for that, can you? You will get a warranty from Canon. You are probably just getting the old body back with new guts. New camera for $700 !?!?

Hello,
I'm trying to repair a damaged dataset using the Repair statement but I'm not getting it. 
The dataset was damaged because my computer crashed while i was inserting data to de dataset and now at reading the dataset it says:
 
Apart from the actual datasets, i have the .sas7bdat files which I'm not sure what they are. Any way of repairing the dataset from there?

If not, I also found this option DLDMGACTION=FAIL here SAS File Management: Repairing Damaged SAS Files, which might work? How would I use it?

 
If both of these options are not there (which means you are just learning an object lesson about the importance of backups, the hard way), try to get SAS Technical Support involved. They may have more advanced means to retrieve hopelessly damaged datasets.

We didn't expect to work for the same company for ages and then have the rug pulled out from under us, or to hop from short-term assignment to short-term assignment for years, sometimes with big gaps in between jobs.
 
People of all ages can have serious concerns about their resumes, because they know that employers are looking closely at their career histories. I've asked many hiring managers what they want to see in a resume, and they always say more or less the same thing: "I want to see that a person has been successful in something, and that they've progressed in their career."

That's okay. You can fix a damaged resume. You can re-frame anything in your past not to hide or obscure it, but to give the person who's reading your resume a better sense of the context for every career move and decision you've made.
 
We all tend to underplay our hands in our job search branding. We write resumes in our company, among many other things. We write Human-Voiced Resumes for our clients. We have written thousands of them, and we have yet to see one single person overstating his or her accomplishments.
 
Paula came to us because she was getting nowhere in her job search. She had not had one job interview in seven months. We talked with Paula and decided on a three-step plan to get her job search moving:
 
We reframed Paula's career story, including her retail job and her employment gap. Now her career story is smooth as silk. It makes sense on her resume. You can see Paula's intelligence and personality coming through the page. Her zigzag career path is a non-issue.
 
I'm an Administrator with a deep background in customer service and a knack for organizing a busy office. I love to juggle projects and keep my fellow employees well-informed and equipped to do their jobs.
 
Paula had spent some time with us and more time on her own thinking about what she wanted to do next in her career. She decided that she liked office administration best. She knows Word and Excel and she's wonderful on the phone.
 
Paula has never held the title Office Manager or Administrative Assistant before - but so what? She has that title now! She got a job with her new resume and the mojo she found again after it had been lost for quite a while.
 
"Paula," we said. "You don't have to convince us! We are on your side. What else were you doing during that time?" It turns out that Paula was busy. Most people are! Most of us get bored pretty easily sitting in front of the TV and organizing the spice cabinet.
 
You can make small gaps disappear by leaving the months of your start and end dates at each job off your resume entirely. No one cares about the months. Remember, your Human-Voiced Resume is a branding document.
 
It isn't a legal document. You're not going to pitch any more resumes into faceless corporate Black Holes if you adopt the Human Workplace worldview and become a Mojofied Job Seeker! You're going to write to hiring managers directly at their desks, instead.
 
You can handle longer gaps by explaining how you consulted during the period between jobs. Paula performed consulting work for her sister, who was building a house, and she consulted with her church, which was launching a summer camp for kids. Paula's sister paid her in hugs and other good sisterly things.
 
The church paid Paula in free admission to camp for her own kids. Paula got paid. I don't want your valuable consulting to be downgraded to 'volunteer' status on your resume. You may volunteer for great causes as well as working.
 
Paula had done several kinds of work before she hit her career crisis and got our help. She had been a supervisor in a hospital Admissions department for a long time. After that she was a dispatcher for a limousine company. Most recently, Paula was a payroll person at a soda bottler. Then she ran into rough waters and ended up in her retail job.
 
The retail job was a big drop in altitude for Paula -- the kind of drop you feel in your stomach. Many of us have been there. "I felt like a loser," said Paula. "I felt like I was letting my family down and letting myself down taking such a basic job because I couldn't find anything better."
 
By retracing her steps, writing in her journal and working on her mojo as a project, Paula realized that her drop in altitude gave her a new perspective. "I worked with some wonderful people who were on their way to better things, and knew where they were headed," said Paula.
 
The first step in reclaiming your lost mojo is seeing how the steps on your path fit together. The steps on Paula's path were all important, but she couldn't see that at the time -- just as most of us cannot!
 
"If you hadn't felt the way you felt, hopeless and dejected," we said, "you wouldn't have met us and you wouldn't be where you are right now." If you met Paula now you would meet a self-assured, funny, smart and joyful woman who inspires everyone she meets.
 
Cetearyl alcohol is a mixed alcohol and is found in a ton of conditioners, moisturizers, and other hair and beauty products. The Environmental Working Group, EWG, which assigns risk to commonly used beauty products, ranks it as reasonably low risk with a score of 1.
 
It is generally recognized as safe by the CDC and FDA and gets an EWG rating of 2-3 depending on use. There are reports of allergic response and sensitivity. This chemical is so widely used, people with sensitive skin would likely know before using Olaplex on their damaged curly hair.
 
Behentrimonium Methosulfate also found in many conditioners, hair serums, shampoos, and coloring products is an anti-static agent and surfactant. Surfactants (also produced by the lungs before birth) are substances that reduce the surface tension of a dissolved liquid. In the body, this prevents your lungs from collapsing at birth. In the beauty world, it may act as a foaming agent, detergent, or emulsifier. The most widely known surfactants are things like soap. As a result, thousands of beauty products contain this ingredient. According to EWG, this surfactant has a score of 3-4, depending on usage. Some people may be allergic to this component.
 
Olaplex is not a conditioner for hair damage and breakage. In other words, you use Olaplex before shampooing, optimally on damp hair. It also is **not**a keratin-based product. Olaplex works on the molecular level of the hair strand (cuticle) on the inside while keratin, another protein, strengthens the outside. Some stylists even suggest or recommend doing both treatments on the same day. You would need to apply Olaplex first (inside repair) and follow with the subsequent protein service (outside repair). If your hair (like low porosity hair) is susceptible to becoming brittle from protein-based products, be careful.
 
Since I have very thick strands with medium density, first I parted my curly hair into four sections using a clip to keep the hair controlled during the process. Then I used a spray bottle with plain water and thoroughly dampened each section. I re-clipped each section of the hair as I went along. Next, I applied the Olaplex No. 3 to each section from root to tip.
 
Honestly, I had shallow expectations for products promising to repair damaged hair. In addition, a number of products promised mystical instant results for your hair that were never delivered. I was waiting for some kind of itching or tingling or something. Nothing.
 
The smell is barely there, and I would describe it as light and pleasant. It certainly is nothing you will notice as you apply it to your hair. Full disclosure, my husband sniffed my curly hair at least twice because it smelled good.
 
In the morning, my curly hair was damp but not wet. The product was partially dry. Needless to say, I was uber nervous bec
