Each parameter is optional; however, you can't specify script arguments without specifying a script. If you don't specify a script or any script arguments, cscript.exe displays the cscript.exe syntax and the valid host options.
 
Windows script files usually have one of the following file name extensions: .wsf, .vbs, .js. Windows Script Host can use .wsf script files. Each .wsf file can use multiple scripting engines and perform multiple jobs.

if you double-click a script file with an extension that has no association, the **Open With** dialog box appears. Select wscript or cscript, and then select **Always use this program to open this file type**. This registers wscript.exe or cscript as the default script host for files of this file type.
 
I created a macro in Excel and i am running it from a .vbs file. It's working fine on my laptop. I copied the same work on a new laptop and each time i am running the vbs file this window appears on the screen.
 
I have made some research and read that the situation i mentioned is happening when loading CheckNDISPort service on the startup. But i don't believe it's the reason because when i go to task manager and check in the startUp tab i don't find this service. Also when i restart my laptop i don't get this window, only when i am running my vbs file. I am sure there is any problem with my vbs file too because on the other laptops it's working fine.
 
Any suggestion please how to get ride of this pop up ? For now i am closing the window each time or ending the task from task manager but everytime i run it again so it pops up again.
Thank you very much.

Windows Scripting Host has two interpreter front-ends, wscript.exe and cscript.exe. cscript.exe is a console application and if cscript.exe is set as the default a console window will open every time you execute a script.
 
I'm trying to add CSCRIPT.exe as an exception to DEP (Data Execution Prevention) in Windows Server 2008 R2. CSCRIPT.exe lives in two locations: C:\Windows\System32 and C:\Windows\SysWOW64. The System32 location is the 64-bit version of the application and 64-bit applications cannot be added to DEP according to Microsoft (and the warning message I get when trying to add it to DEP.) Trying to add the SysWOW64 version gives an entirely different error/warning message. "This program must run with DEP enabled, you can't turn it off".
 
I've tried renaming and moving CSCRIPT.exe to a different location and/or renaming it with no difference. For this use case DEP must be enabled and for the purposes of this specific question - I need to disable DEP just for this application.
 
One thing I did try was to use the CSCRIPT.exe from Windows Server 2003. I'm able to add this file to DEP successfully. However, something really bothers me about using the old version. I feel like I could be introducing a security risk or a version issue.
 
EDIT: I understand that something may need to "give" with this particular question. I might not be able to get to common ground. If that's the case, so be it. I don't want to spend the time and effort to reinvent the wheel if its unnecessary. Thanks!
 
VBScript predates DEP in Windows, and as such it was not originally developed with DEP in mind. Furthermore when you start interacting with old, third-party COM and OLE interfaces in your scripts, they can cause NX faults and cscript.exe takes the blame for it. The latter is usually the case.
 
For the purposes of application compatibility when DEP is set to the OptOut policy level, it is possible to selectively disable DEP for individual 32-bit applications. However, DEP is always enabled for 64-bit applications.
 
So that leaves you with the 32bit, "SysWOW64" version of cscript.exe... however, modern executables can and usually are flagged with a "you can't turn DEP off on me," flag. Much like in the same way that an executable can be flagged as being large address space aware, etc.
 
Technically, it's the /NXCOMPAT flag that the executable was compiled with. It's a linker switch. The old 2003 version of the executable was not compiled with that switch, and that is why you are able to put it in the DEP exemptions list but not the 2008 version.
 
I have scheduled a task in windows server 2008R2 ..I want to run a VBScript so when I setup the task I call the cscript at C:\Windows\System32\cscript.exe and in the arguments section I am passing //nologo //B d:\main\programs\copy.vbs /targets:contents but it is not executing my script ..If I call my script directly in the start program section it works fine but it's not working if I call CSrcipt and pass in arguments the status changes to queued but nothing happens after that..Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong here.
 
Unless you get an Information event with source WSH and event-ID 4, your script isn't running at all. Check the eventlog and the task's History tab for clues as to why that is. Also check the permissions of the script. Is the runas account of the task able to access/run the file? You can check that by starting a CMD instance as that user
 
The problem I'm facing is that when the VBScript is run, the SSL/TLS handshake fails when communicating with the Windows Service if Eset SSL/TLS filtering is turned on. What's confusing is that if I create a .NET/C# client that makes use of the same library as the VBScript one, the communication does not fail when Eset SSL/TLS filtering is on. The only difference is that the .NET/C# client is its own executable, whereas the VBScript is hosted within the cscript.exe one.
 
Thanks for the suggestion. I've tried to turn AMSI off, but unfortunately the same issue persists. For what it's worth, here's what gets written to the console when I run cscript.exe against the VBScript:

Cscript.exe is the main executable for Windows Script Host (WSH). It is essentially the command-line version of the WSH service and facilitates command-line options for setting up script properties. With Cscript, scripts can be run automatically or by simply typing the name of the script file inside the command prompt.
 
How to find the location of a cscript executable file? In general, press **Ctrl + Shif + Enter** immediately you see the Cscript.exe running to open up a Windows Task Manager window. Then, go to the **Processes** tab and search for the cscript.exe service. When you find it, just investigate its location.
 
On Windows 10/11 operation system (OS), right-click on the Cscript file and select **Open file location**. If the location of the target file is different than C:\Windows\System32, it is probably malware or viruses. Then, you need to rely on some security tools to help you distinguish and remove the malware for you.
 
Cscript.exe refers to the Microsoft Windows Script Host (WSH), which is formerly called Windows Scripting Host. It is an automation technology for Windows systems. WSH offers scripting abilities comparable to batch files but with a wider range of supported features.
 
Wscript is a means of automation for Internet Explorer (IE) through the installed WSH engines from IE 3.0 onwards when VBScript became means of automation for Outlook 97. It is also an optional install provided with a VBScript and JScript engine for Windows CE 3.0 and following and some 3rd party engines including Rexx as well as other forms of Basic.
 
Cscript.exe is language-independent in that it can rely on different Active Scripting language engines. It interprets and runs plain-text JScript (.js and .jse files) and VBScript (.vbs and .vbs files) by default.
 
Users are able to install different scripting engines to enable them to script in other languages such as PerlScript. Besides, the language-independent filename extension WSF (Windows Script File) can also be taken advantage of. WSF enables multiple scripts and a combination of scripting languages within a single file.
 
If you double-click a script file with an extension that has no association, the Open with dialog box appears. Then, just choose cscript or wscript and select Always use this program to open this file type. This registers cscript.exe or WScript.ex as the default script host for files of that file extension.
 
And, to create a backup of crucial files is always a good way to prevent data loss due to all kinds of malware attacks or other accidents. To make a backup of vital data, you need a professional and reliable application like MiniTool ShadowMaker, which allows you to not only back up files/fodders but also system and hard disks, as well as under an automatic schedule backup.
 
Thanks, I will give this a shot and see what happens. I still have a
lot to learn about powershell and appreciate all of the support in
helping to get this script off the ground and running.
I was able to verify that the vbscript works by running it on a couple
servers and had no issues with it prior to writing the powershell
script to run it remotely.
Just to be sure that it was something in the powershell script and not
the vbscript, i create a quick vbscript that would just create a text
file with a one line sentence on the c:\ of a server. I ran it locally
and it worked with no issues, however, once I ran it from the script,
it would kick off the cscript process but quit shortly after without
leaving a file.I will use your rec
