The Montage is supposed to have a much bigger sound library than the Motif so where is it ?. For example in performance mode and selecting category search there are only 16 main headings and 8 sub headings and by clicking on all main headings there are only two that have pop/rock performances and each of these has only one. The category search on my Motif had pages and pages of sounds and performances compared to what I can find on the Montage. All the demos on YouTube show people playing beats/bass/arpeggios with the left hand and lead with the right hand but when I select a performance every key plays the same sound just like a piano. I hope that it is just me having a total lack of understanding of the Montage but at the moment I am thinking that I have made a very expensive mistake ? .
 
Once you learn basic navigation, the idea is to assemble your own Performances. Selecting your own items to trigger with left hand chords if that is where you want to go. While all of the XF arpeggio content is in .Montage, none of the XF Four Part Performances are repeated in Montage. Zero!

Looking at the data list for Montage vs Motif XF shows 700 more performances for Montage. The categories for performances leaves something to be desired, so I wouldn't necessarily use this. Download the data list and take a look at the performance list. You could do the same with searches on the keyboard but looking at the list may be easier to deal with.
 
But then, I too am longing for an option to do solo-gigs with full-band support. Not using the Tyros, but my Montage.
There is a backing module like the Roland BK-7.
But it is already a very old system, and doesn't sound the way I want it. And certainly doesn't support Montage features.
And modern equipment like the Toraiz doesn't support keyboard styles.
 
Imagine to be a DJ-producer-keyboard player in one. LIVE. On the fly!!!. Real-time adaptable, and not limited to pre-programmed sequences and/or Cubase midi-files. Just change the chord in your left hand, and your band will follow. Yamaha has the technology. It is in the Tyros. If they only would come up with a stand-alone backing module. Even guitar players would then be able to produce some sensible music. ?
 
Hello Chris - 'Easy Sounds' (Google them) have a series of articles in the 'Yamaha Music Production Guide' that are down-loadable and may help to get going with Montage, but it is a synthesiser rather than an arranger. Check through the 'Performances' (can mislead you - think of them as 'Voices') - press 'Category Search' then set the 'Main' to 'All' and the 'Bank' to 'Preset' (forget the Categories for the moment) and go through all 1,972 of them. Play with the flashing Super-knob (the flashing can be turned off, thank God!). Something for everyone - and each and every one can be tweaked and twitched almost infinitely. Staggering! Arpeggios and Sequences can be used as backing tracks - find your way around the navigation system. It's quite complex - the sheer volume of traffic on this site testifies to that - but comprehensive. I've had mine for 9 months, and initially thought I'd made a mistake - wrong! I do have issues with it, mainly in sound quality (separate thread) but I wouldn't part with it now!
 
Also, other than performances one way to look at this is by the waveform count. The waveforms are the individual sounds that are the building blocks for Motif XF's voices (and, by extension performances) as well as Montage's PARTs (... and performances). The Motif XF has 3,977 of these waveforms. Montage has 6,347. Many more building blocks for sound.

Thanks all for your detailed replies all of which are very much appreciated.
I already own a Tyros 5 and accept that the Montage doesn't have 'styles' but I was not expecting it to be so different to the Motif especially as it was promoted as being able to do so much straight out of the box. The four part 'performance' mode in the Motif was to me a very nice feature as I am purely a hobbyist and not a live player and these were so easy to select from the menus and edit as required. It looks like I will be spending a lot of evenings getting to grips with the Montage and take heart from Rod who had the same thoughts as me when he purchased his.
However I still don't get that there are only 2 pop/rock voice/performances in ALL of the main headings, on my Motif there were hundreds.
 
Hi Chris. I too was a bit disappointed when I got my Montage that there was no Motif like performances. Never owned a motif but played with one at stores. Enjoyed the performances. However, the Montage offers all the "ingredients" to create your own Motif like performances. Check videos by this Korean Yamaha demonstrator in YouTube. Look for lesson 34 & 35. He teaches how to create these performances and programming different arpeggios to scenes. I don't understand a single word of Korean but by watching what he is doing, you can learn how to create your own performances. It takes a bit of time but it's lots of fun once you get the hang of it. Enjoy!
 
I personally dont like how the motif is full of performances with beats etc that I'll never ever use live. I prefer a large number of great quality sounds using articulations etc that I can build lives sets from. Splits and Layers are nice along with control that the super knob provides. But then everyone uses the Montage for different things, some people just like to Jam at home or feel inspired by a pre-made sequence. I play live in covers bands so think the Montage will suit me well as long as I can get my head round its lacking midi master functions.
 
It's a real bummer that the Montage almost doesn't boast any of the "accompaniment/solo" performances from the XF/MOXF.
It does have all the arps, but nothing is interconnected. It makes no sense. after all, it's all there. right now, you'll be told to create your own. but its a tedious process, to go over hundreds of arps, selecting the best that fit the performance, when all the work was already done previously on the XF.
 
Yamaha (or through one of its affiliate) will make a conversion of the XF/MOXF performances for the Montage sometime soon (at cost or no cost I'm not sure, but I'd gladly pay for this). this is a part of their to-do list.
 
It seems then that I am not the only one who is missing the "accompaniment/solo" performances that were so easy to call up on the Motif. Don't get me wrong, in no way am I knocking the Montage and was fully aware that it wasn't simply an upgrade of the XF. Saying that however, purely as a home hobby player I really didn't expect to have to program everything from scratch and now miss being able to switch it on press a couple of buttons and be playing a preset performance. Maybe as Eyal has said, someone will make a conversion of the XF performances for the Montage which will suit the type of owner as myself.
 
Hi - I am new here and this is my first post. I have hooked up my new Tyros 5 to my Logic Pro X and am looking for a way to properly select voice changes. It has automatically created a 'workstation' instrument in Logic but this seems to only give me access to 127 voices (look like GM standards to me). Is there a way that I can set up a multi instrument in Logic so that it lets me select any of the voices from the T5?
 
Having read other posts on this site I can prob work out how to use custom banks in LP but looking at the data list for the Tyros, the instruments are all distributed across various banks / combos of MSB/LSB - for example all pianos are dotted around different banks. Ideally I would like to set up so that all pianos show listed together. Help please?
 
I use Logic with a Tryos 5 - works fine.. This is a control sequence I made and put into my template. Tyros uses three parameters to access its sounds MSB/LSB/PROG. I fill in the last three values to get the voice I want.. You can also use any CC's to further modify the sound of the Tyros sound..
 
In Tyros go to UTILITY page, CONFIG 2, VOICE NUMBER. Switch this to show ON... Now you will see the voice #'s in the window whenever you select a patch on Tyros.. Copy these values to the Logic Control sequence, which I put at measure 0 in Logic..
 
You should create 16 control seqs for 16 tracks..I stagger the times slightly.. Cause if you send too many CC or any events at the same clock count.. Tyros or any instrument might not be able to respond time
 
You can also call up programs with sysex code.. but it was too complicated for me to figure out. Logic also has it's own I think it might also be possible to create custom banks combinations and program.. But Logic can only access 15 custom bank combos (MSB/LSB/) and the Tyros uses a lot more MSB/LSB combinations. so this is the method I use..
 
Good luck.. Once you get used to filling in the values, it's nothing.. When you closely examine the Tyros 5 MIDI pages, you realize they put some thought into using Tyros with a DAW.. There are a lot of little tricks you come up with.. I create a 'chord' track in Logic, feed that to Tyros, and then record Tyros' style generator parts into Logic.. I then add my control sequence and assign them to other MIDI tracks.. Play that. So Tyros now plays the parts you just created, and will generate another set of style generated parts.. etc.. etc.
 
AngeloNYC, can you please expand a bit on your file I've downloaded? Is this midi file placed at the beginning of each of the 16 tracks? I'm having difficulty understanding (let alone editing it for instrument selection).
 
On Tyros go to Utility/CONFIG 2... Turn ON 'VOICE NUMBER" to 'show'.. This way when you select an instrument on Tyros front panel, you w
