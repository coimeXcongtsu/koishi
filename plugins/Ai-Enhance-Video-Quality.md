The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a dog-assisted therapy intervention to enhance quality of life in persons with dementia institutionalized in a public care home and to study its effect on the use of psychotropic medications. A dog-assisted therapy intervention was designed, in which 34 residents of a public care home in Cuenca (Spain) participated. The participants were assigned to two groups, an experimental and a control group. The program consisted of one 50-min session per week during 9 months. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare post-training values between groups, using baseline values as covariates. Our findings do seem to support the hypothesis that Animal-Assisted Therapy may contribute to enhancing quality of life for residents in an aged care home. However, aspects such as the format, time, and content of the sessions as well as their possibilities of reducing psychotropic medication require more research.
 
Research shows that poor sleep can have a negative effect on your thinking ability, mood, heart health, immune health, and more. It can also increase your chances of developing obesity and diabetes, among other health conditions.
 
There are several popular methods you can use to reduce nighttime blue light exposure. These include wearing glasses that block blue light and turning off the TV, other devices, and any bright lights 2 hours before bed.
 
A single dose of caffeine can enhance focus, energy, and sports performance. However, the authors of a 2023 research review found that late caffeine consumption reduced total sleep time by 45 minutes and overall sleep efficiency by 7%.
 
But the effects of napping vary from person to person. For example, a 2021 review suggests that napping might be helpful for people who are athletes or engage in strenuous physical activity and might not compromise their nighttime sleep quality.

In a 2024 review, researchers examined nine studies on sleep quality involving various bedding and sleepwear materials, including cotton, polyester, wool, duck down, goose down, polyester, linen, and a blend of cotton and polyester.
 
Different materials were found to improve sleep in varying conditions. For example, wool appeared to help adults fall asleep in cool temperatures, while linen appeared to improve sleep quality for young adults in warm temperatures. Goose down was also found to increase slow-wave sleep for young adults in cooler environments.
 
Practicing relaxation techniques before bed has been shown to improve sleep quality. These techniques are also a common method used to treat insomnia. Examples include mindfulness, meditation, and even listening to music.
 
You might also experience insomnia, which can be caused by factors such as stress and underlying medical conditions. According to a 2020 research review, at least 10% of adults have chronic insomnia, and 20% experience it occasionally.
 
The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend getting 150 minutes of exercise per week. If you spread this throughout the week and make sure to leave a few hours between your workout and bedtime, you may notice a positive effect on your sleep quality.
 
This is one strategy for better sleep. Starting 10 hours before bedtime, avoid consuming caffeine. Three hours before bed, limit alcohol and food. Two hours before bed, try to relax and avoid mentally taxing tasks. One hour before bed put away all your electronics.
 
There are many strategies you can try to help yourself learn to sleep better. For starters, it can be helpful to establish a sleep routine. Then, you can work on making your environment more conducive to sleep, reducing light and noise close to bedtime, and limiting the foods and drinks you consume before you go to bed.

A new year and another Photoshop AI feature to get excited about. This time, we're going to look at how you can take poor, low quality images with tiny file sizes and plenty of ugly artifacts and turn them into images of such quality you could even consider printing them.
 
Over the course of December last year, I played around a lot with various AI tools. As it so happened, we had a professional development session at my place of employment in which AI was discussed in the educational context. Although it related primarily to academic writing, a lot of other AI capabilities were mentioned, including photography and the arts. The general consensus among my peers was that AI is here, and it is not going anywhere, so we need to understand how to work with it, rather than against it.
 
And that brings us to this great video by Unmesh Dinda from PiXimperfect, in which he introduces another AI feature in the latest version of Photoshop. As with most of Photoshop's AI features, it's in the Neural Filters section, which can be found under the Filters drop-down menu. Once you open that, at the bottom, you'll see JPEG Artifacts Removal. You simply toggle that on, choose whether you want (high, medium, or low), and then let Photoshop do its work. It can be rather intensive on your computer, but the results on various photos I tested were incredible, including iPhone images with lots of grain and noise. There's also advice on how to correct extreme banding. Give the video a look to see it in action and how you can apply it. What are your thoughts on AI?
