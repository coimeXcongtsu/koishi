The Septuagint is an ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament. It was a key factor in readability as Greek had become the common language by the time of Christ. At Blue Letter Bible, we have offered the Septuagint (LXX) for many years, which is regarded as the most credible Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament. Now, we are pleased to offer Brenton's English Septuagint (BES), an English translation of the Greek Septuagint.
 
At BLB, we recognize the usefulness of studying God's Word using the Greek Septuagint, especially in instances where a New Testament writer references the Greek Septuagint translation. Thus, the BES translation is just one more of the in-depth Septuagint tools that we offer. While checking out the BES, be sure to open up the Tools button, and take a look at the Septuagint tab with each Greek word and parsing.
 
We have been blessed by a wonderful partnership with Kress Biblical Resources for several years. Previously, we have offered their Road Maps for the New Testament Epistles and Revelation. Now, we are very excited to provide the *Road Maps for the Gospel of John*.
 
The Gospel of John is one of the richest collections of the words and life of Christ in Scripture. It contains many unique dialogues with Christ and His disciples that are beautifully deep. This is all working towards the two-fold aim as outlined in the "Introductory Matters": (1) "to call for and cultivate genuine trust in Christ as Son of God and the Source of eternal life" and (2) "to reveal the glory of Jesus Christ as God incarnate and point to Him as the only Source of divine light and life."
