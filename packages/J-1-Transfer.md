The Transfer Code of Practice responds to the expressed needs of the scholarly journal community for consistent guidelines to help publishers ensure that journal content remains easily accessible by librarians and readers when there is a transfer between parties, and to ensure that the transfer process occurs with minimum disruption. The Code contains best practice guidelines for both the Transferring Publisher and the Receiving Publisher. Publishers are asked to endorse the Code, and to abide by its principles wherever it is commercially reasonable to do so.
 
Transfer originated with the United Kingdom Serials Group (UKSG) and moved to the auspices of NISO in 2014.
 
The Code is governed by a group of librarians, publishers and other experts (the Transfer Standing Committee), and its main activities fall into three areas:
 
1. The Transfer Code of Practice. The current version is the Transfer Code of Practice, Version 4.0. 

A list of the publishers that currently endorse the Code can be found on the Publisher Endorsement page.
 
2. The Transfer Alerting Service. This service has been designed to facilitate communication of journal transfers. Read more about it.

The Transfer project was initiated by UKSG in 2006 in response to issues identified by the scholarly communications community when journal titles change platform providers or owners. In the first ten months of 2006, EBSCO logged over 5,000 titles that changed publishers. Such transfers can negatively impact libraries, intermediaries (such as serials subscription agents, link resolver administrators, and vendors of large-scale discovery systems), and readers. Often the journal would seem to disappear and links from existing information systems to the content would break, even though the title was still being published.
 
This standard outlines the elements, organization and design of scientific and technical reports, including guidance for uniform presentation of front and back matter, text, and visual and tabular matter in print and digital formats, as well as recommendations for multimedia reports.
 
The Standard Address Number (SAN) is a seven-digit numeric identifier used to identify organizations and businesses interacting with the publishing industry (including book and serial manufacturers, libraries, publishers, etc.). Originally created to expedite paper-based transactions such as purchase orders and returns, the SAN has been designated as the organizational identifier for use in EDI transactions in the publishing industry.
 
Guidance is presented for authors and editors preparing abstracts that represent the content of texts reporting on the results of experimental work or descriptive or discursive studies. Suggestions for the placement of abstracts within publications or other media are given, along with recommendations for abstracting specific documents. Types of abstracts and their content are described. Also included are suggestions on the style of abstracts and a list of selected readings on the subject of abstracting. Examples of abstracts are appended.
