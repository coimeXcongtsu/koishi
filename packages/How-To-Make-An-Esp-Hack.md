Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a filecalled the *makefile*, which lists each of the non-source filesand how to compute it from other files. When you write a program, youshould write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make tobuild and install the program.
 
As a result, if you change a few source files and then run Make, itdoes not need to recompile all of your program. It updates only thosenon-source files that depend directly or indirectly on the sourcefiles that you changed.
 
A *rule* in the makefile tells Make how to execute a series ofcommands in order to build a *target* file from source files.It also specifies a list of *dependencies* of the target file.This list should include all files (whether source files or other targets)which are used as inputs to the commands in the rule.
 
When you run Make, you can specify particular targets to update;otherwise, Make updates the first target listed in the makefile. Ofcourse, any other target files needed as input for generating thesetargets must be updated first.
 
Make uses the makefile to figure out which target files ought to bebrought up to date, and then determines which of them actually need tobe updated. If a target file is newer than all of its dependencies,then it is already up to date, and it does not need to be regenerated.The other target files do need to be updated, but in the right order:each target file must be regenerated before it is used in regeneratingother targets.

GNU Make also has a few simple features that are very convenient. Forexample, the -o *file* option which says ``pretend thatsource file *file* has not changed, even though it has changed.''This is extremely useful when you add a new macro to a header file.Most versions of Make will assume they must therefore recompile all thesource files that use the header file; but GNU Make gives you a way toavoid the recompilation, in the case where you know your change to theheader file does not require it.
 
We have developed conventions for how to write Makefiles, which allGNU packages ought to follow. It is a good idea to follow theseconventions in your program even if you don't intend it to be GNUsoftware, so that users will be able to build your package justlike many other packages, and will not need to learn anything specialbefore doing so.
 
Documentation forMakeis online, as is documentation for mostGNU software. It can also be accessed by runninginfo make orman make, or by looking at/usr/share/doc/make/,or similar directories on your system. A brief summary is available byrunning make --help.
 
Security reports that should not be made immediately public can besent directly to the maintainer. If there is no response to an urgentissue, you can escalate to the generalsecuritymailing list for advice.
 
Development ofMake,and GNU in general, is a volunteer effort, and you can contribute. Forinformation, please read How to help GNU. If you'dlike to get involved, it's a good idea to join the discussion mailinglist (see above).

The *make* utility shall update files that are derived from other files. A typical case is one where object files arederived from the corresponding source files. The *make* utility examines time relationships and shall update those derivedfiles (called targets) that have modified times earlier than the modified times of the files (called prerequisites) from which theyare derived. A description file (makefile) contains a description of the relationships between files, and the commands that need tobe executed to update the targets to reflect changes in their prerequisites. Each specification, or rule, shall consist of atarget, optional prerequisites, and optional commands to be executed when a prerequisite is newer than the target. There are twotypes of rule:
 
The characters are formatted in a manner similar to a portion of the *make* utility command line: options are preceded by characters and -separated as described in XBD *Utility Syntax Guidelines*. The *macro*= *value* macro definitionoperands can also be included. The difference between the contents of *MAKEFLAGS* and the *make* utility command line isthat the contents of the variable shall not be subjected to the word expansions (see *wordexp*) associated with parsing the command line values.
 
The value of the *SHELL* environment variable shall not be used as a macro and shall not be modified by defining the**SHELL** macro in a makefile or on the command line. All other environment variables, including those with null values, shallbe used as macros, as defined in Macros.
 
If not already ignored, *make* shall trap SIGHUP, SIGTERM, SIGINT, and SIGQUIT and remove the current target unless thetarget is a directory or the target is a prerequisite of the special target **.PRECIOUS** or unless one of the **-n**,**-p**, or **-q** options was specified. Any targets removed in this manner shall be reported in diagnostic messages ofunspecified format, written to standard error. After this cleanup process, if any, *make* shall take the standard action forall other signals.
 
The *make* utility shall write all commands to be e
