It is a feeling that something is wrong or a desire to make a positive change in a particular area. This burden is not something we create ourselves but something God places in our hearts to stir us toward action.
 
Take the **example of William Wilberforce**, a British politician who fought against the slave trade in the 18th and 19th centuries. After a religious conversion, Wilberforce felt burdened by the injustice of slavery. He dedicated his life to abolishing the slave trade, using his position in Parliament to raise awareness and gather support.

Buford, a successful entrepreneur, embarked on his halftime journey. Drawing from his experiences, Buford guides us towards a life of personal significance, helping us tap into our unique gifts and callings.
 
According to Bob Buford, the second half of life offers the chance for a personal renaissance, during which accomplishment becomes of permanent value. To take advantage of this chance, one must assess their strategy and work to surpass their first-half successes regarding their legacy.
 
Bob began questioning his purpose and sought to make his **life more than just** **financially prosperous** **.** He pondered vital questions about his true purpose, the significance of his work, and the meaning of having it all.
 
Bob cites the words of **Norman Corwin**, who described the transition into middle age as breaking the sound barrier, signaling the potential for personal growth and discovery. He also quotes **George Bernard Shaw**, emphasizing the joy and purpose of serving others.
 
Buford illustrates that while belief in God is often present, people sometimes get caught between disbelief and fully knowing and experiencing God. He argues that this struggle is a natural part of the human experience and stems from the complexity of understanding and quantifying God.
 
Buford also criticizes the church for assuming that those who attend regularly do not honestly believe in God. He asserts that many churchgoers are God-seeking individuals who already believe but may be unsure how to apply their beliefs in their daily lives.
 
This period of reflection often occurs when people reach a point in their careers where they have achieved financial success but feel a desire for more profound meaning and purpose in their lives. They start questioning the true significance of their accomplishments and what they want to leave behind as their legacy.
 
Buford also discusses the importance of finding balance in life and staying centered. He mentions a study by Harvard ethicist Laura Nash, highlighting the tensions Christians face in the marketplace, such as serving God versus pursuing wealth, balancing family and work, and managing charity versus wealth.
 
Business owners and executives must pursue their God-given purpose during their Halftime because it brings a sense of fulfillment and meaning beyond material success. It allows them to align their work with their values, find greater satisfaction in their endeavors, and positively impact the world around them.
 
With the wisdom gained from life experiences, we can prioritize what truly matters, realign our goals, and dedicate our time and energy to fulfilling our God-given purpose with greater clarity and intention.

Before the war, Forrest amassed substantial wealth as a cotton plantation owner, horse and cattle trader, real estate broker, and slave trader. In June 1861, he enlisted in the Confederate Army and became one of the few soldiers during the war to enlist as a private and be promoted to general without previous military training. An expert cavalry leader, Forrest was given command of a corps and established new doctrines for mobile forces, earning the nickname "The Wizard of the Saddle". He used his cavalry troops as mounted infantry and often deployed artillery as the lead in battle, thus helping to "revolutionize cavalry tactics".[3][4] While scholars generally acknowledge Forrest's skills and acumen as a cavalry leader and military strategist, he is a controversial figure in U.S. history for prewar slave trading, his role in the massacre of several hundred U.S. Army soldiers at Fort Pillow, a majority of them black, and his postwar leadership of the Klan.
 
In April 1864, in what has been called "one of the bleakest, saddest events of American military history",[5] troops under Forrest's command at the Battle of Fort Pillow massacred hundreds of surrendered troops, composed of black soldiers and white Tennessean Southern Unionists fighting for the United States. Forrest was blamed for the slaughter in the U.S. press, and this news may have strengthened the United States's resolve to win the war. Forrest's level of responsibility for the massacre is still debated by historians.[6]
 
Forrest, who was a Freemason,[7] joined the Ku Klux Klan in 1867 (two years after its founding) and was elected its first Grand Wizard. The group was a loose collection of local factions throughout the former Confederacy that used violence or threats of violence to maintain white control over the newly enfranchised, formerly enslaved people. The Klan, with Forrest at the lead, suppressed the voting rights of blacks in the Southern United States through violence and intimidation during the elections of 1868. In 1869, Forrest expressed disillusionment with the lack of discipline in the white supremacist terrorist group across the South,[8] and issued a letter ordering the dissolution of the Ku Klux Klan as well as the destruction of its costumes; he then withdrew from the organization.[9] In the last years of his life, Forrest denied being a Klan member[10] and, disturbed by anti-black violence, made statements in support of racial harmony and black dignity.[11]
 
In June 2021, the remains of Forrest and his wife were exhumed from Health Sciences Park, where they had been buried for over 100 years, and where a monument of him once stood. They were later reburied in Columbia, Tennessee. In July 2021, Tennessee officials voted to move Forrest's bust from the State Capitol to the Tennessee State Museum.[12]
 
Nathan Bedford Forrest was born on July 13, 1821, to a poor settler family in a secluded frontier cabin near Chapel Hill hamlet, then part of Bedford County, Tennessee, but now in Marshall County.[13][14] Forrest was the first son of Mariam (Beck) and William Forrest.[14] His blacksmith father was of English descent, and most of his biographers state that his mother was of Scotch-Irish descent, but the Memphis Genealogical Society says that she was of English descent.[15] He and his twin sister, Fanny, were the two eldest of 12 children. Their great-grandfather, Shadrach Forrest, moved between 1730 and 1740 from Virginia to North Carolina, where his son and grandson were born; they moved to Tennessee in 1806.[14] Forrest's family lived in a log house (now preserved as the Nathan Bedford Forrest Boyhood Home) from 1830 to 1833.[16] John Allan Wyeth, who served in an Alabama regiment under Forrest, described it as a one-room building with a loft and no windows.[17] William Forrest worked as a blacksmith in Tennessee until 1834, when he moved with his family to Salem, Mississippi.[14][18] William died in 1837 and Forrest became the primary caretaker of the family at age 16.[14]
 
In 1841 Forrest went into business with his uncle Jonathan Forrest in Hernando, Mississippi. His uncle was killed there in 1845 during an argument with the Matlock brothers. In retaliation, Forrest shot and killed two of them with his two-shot pistol and wounded two others with a knife thrown to him. One of the wounded Matlock men survived and served under Forrest during the Civil War.[19] Forrest's early business ventures included a livery stable, a stagecoach line, and a brickyard.[20]
 
Forrest was well known as a Memphis speculator and Mississippi gambler.[21] In 1858, Forrest was elected a Memphis city alderman as a Southern Democrat and served two consecutive terms.[22][23] In 1859, he bought two large cotton plantations in Coahoma County, Mississippi and a half-interest in another plantation in Arkansas;[24] by October 1860, he owned at least 3,345 acres in Mississippi.[25] He acquired several cotton plantations in the Delta region of West Tennessee.[14][26][14][27] By the time the American Civil War started in 1861, he had become one of the wealthiest men in the Southern United States, having amassed a "personal fortune that he claimed was worth $1.5 million".[28]
 
Forrest stood 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) in height and weighed about 180 pounds (82 kg).[29][30][31][32] He was noted as having a "striking and commanding presence" by U.S. Army Captain Lewis Hosea, an aide to Gen. James H. Wilson. Forrest r
