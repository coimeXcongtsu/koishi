1000 years later after the events of 1000 Years, Null will be thrown into the deep end, seeing if he will sink or swim. How will he cope with his newfound freedom? Will it be what he hoped for? And most importantly, what will crack first? the eggshells he treads on, or he himself?
 
Quite frankly...Celestia deserves whatever he's about to do to her. While, granted, her putting Null in stone may have actually been something of a blessing in disguise since it allowed him time to get a handle on his powers...she didn't know that at the time, and had him petrified for very flimsy reasons.

The other one is a paranoid freak who is obsessed with virtue, righteousness of herself. and has even stated that she blames you for an inevitable event that she herself caused. ie. she is willing to shift blame to avoid self-guilt despite how flimsy her evidence is.

hm, hm, a fair point. but think about what you just said. just got free'd from wrongful imprisonment. after a 1000 year bender, and clearly not right in the head. you think he'd be capable of making a proper logical decision that would make sense? hell nah. he's pissed. on top of which, what would you expect him to do? knock on the door calmly and ask to talk? nope. for him, this has been a long time coming. he's gonna do what he's not gotten to do in a long ass time. VENT.

"Ya know, Catain Bookboi just brought up that one. Eh, all's fair and ends fair. Though I for a fact know that this world of theirs is unfair. Almost as much as that one, literal, kid who Celestia chased through a continent."
 
You know, I've never really considered what Nurgle actually sounds like before, but I think you're spot on. That kind of indeterminately accented seedy pawnshop owner, the guy who smokes like fifty cigarettes a day but still wants to give you sound lifestyle advice.

"That'a common confusion mortals make. See, Gods ain't called gods for squat, and an aspect ain't even an aspect to begin with. Mortals like to assign roles and labels to everything' they see based on How they see it. It got so far with those, till they named half the whole f\*ckin' pantheon and most 'a their planet. A god ain't presiding over any aspect. What makes a god look and act the way they do is how much power they have, And how that power aflicts everything around them. No labels here, you can call Aphrodite, Venus. But at the end 'a the day e's the same petty nimbitch with a black-hole for a c\*nt and an attention-seeking compelx that rivals Zeus's sex drive."
 
When we think about remnants of ancient civilizations, we often think of places like Egypt, Greece or Italy. Athens, Cairo and Rome are certainly places people visit for the primary purpose of observing and learning about history. However, one thing I learned about travel, generally speaking, is that history is all around us. Evidence of historical events, both the human and natural kind, can be found almost everywhere, and sometimes in some unexpected places.
 
Wupatki National Monument sits about 30 miles north of Flagstaff and is easily accessible via U.S. highway 89. Those traveling through the area can visit the remnants of several abandoned pueblos, as well as sunset crater, the site of a volcanic eruption, on a convenient 36 mile scenic drive.
 
Some things were certainly different from our lives today. For example, they did not have the means to travel long distances, as horses would be introduced by the Spanish centuries later. So, there were few journeys or adventures. However, based on human nature, there was certainly the friendships, conflicts, drama, power struggles, rivalries, parties, shared experiences and accomplishments that go along with life in towns and cities.
 
Evidence points to this volcano erupting in the later half of the 11th century. The eruption was seen by Anasazi and Sinagua inhabitants of the region. They probably talked about it for years, possibly even the entire two-ish centuries between the eruption and their mysterious departure from the region.
 
I began to wonder what other records, knowledge and traditions were lost when these civilizations collapsed. Could they have had scientific knowledge that we will never benefit from? Did they have philosophical ideas worthy of our consideration? Is there a history we could be learning from?
 
As I took a deep breath and gazed out into the open sky I thought about a phenomenon I had first thought of nearly 20 years ago. Right now, there is something happening, in another town, involving people I do not know yet, that will have a significant impact on my life. The same can be said for anyone else, including anyone reading this entry.
 
Talk to some of the folks who lived through the bombing of 62nd and Osage Avenue in West Philadelphia 30 years ago, and you'll notice that they refer to the MOVE bombing simply by its full date. May 13, 1985.
 
That's how Perry Moody refers to it, too. His house is on the north side of Pine Street. On that day three decades ago, he was evacuated from the block but watched from nearby as the houses on the other side of the street were swallowed up by flames.
 
Ramona Africa refers to it that way, too. She was inside the targeted house at 6221 Osage while it was battered by police bullets and deluge guns and, eventually, brought down by a makeshift bomb dropped from a police helicopter. Ramona Africa managed to escape the burning building. Her compatriots in MOVE, the radical organization to which she belonged and that had been engaged in a standoff with the City of Philadelphia, were not so fortunate.
 
The MOVE bombing was a catastrophe for my hometown, and became part of the collective memories of Philadelphians of a certain age. I grew up in South Philly, about a 20-minute drive from ground zero, but I was only 4 when it happened and too young to remember the actual day. As I got older, I would learn about it in bites and fragments, and come to understand the central role it played in the history of policing in my hometown.
 
Today, the narrow block at ground zero sits eerily quiet. Most of the homes built to replace the ones destroyed by the fire are now vacant, boarded up, and padlocked. The residents who stuck around, like Renfrow, are in limbo. Maybe the city will rehabilitate these buildings. Maybe it will raze them. As most of the people responsible for the tragedy and the city have moved on to fresher political dilemmas, it's been pretty easy for 62nd and Osage to be forgotten altogether.
 
The residents who never left the 6200 block of Osage Avenue are quick to recall what their neighborhood was like before the spring of 1985: a nice block right by Cobbs Creek Park, part of a safe, close-knit community where folks barbecued together while their kids played in the street. I wanted to talk to them and others who lived through that day in Philadelphia about what they remembered.
 
The residents near 62nd and Osage ahead evacuated from their homes ahead of the standoff. The police told them to take some clothes and toothbrushes. The police told them all they should be back in their homes by the next day.
 
The final warnings from the police started that morning, a little after 5:30. "Attention, MOVE ... This is America," Gregore Sambor, the police commissioner, yelled into his megaphone to the people in the compound. "You have to abide by the laws of the United States."
 
Meanwhile, SWAT teams tried to blast holes into the side of the compound via the adjoining row houses. That plan didn't work. TV reporters at the scene ducked for cover while trying to file their dispatches. Spectators and residents gathered at barricades nearby to watch. As the standoff dragged on, police set off more explosions to try to gain entry to the building. The cops couldn't get inside, and the MOVE folks still weren't coming out.
 
But the bomb had set the roof on fire, and soon smoke was billowing over the tops of the row houses. The blaze seemed to be spreading, but the firefighters were ordered by Sambor, the police commissioner, to stand down. ("I communicated ... that I would like to let the fire burn," he later told the city commission.)
 
Within 45 minutes, three more homes on the block were on fire, too. Then the roof of the MOVE house buckled under the flames and collapsed. By the time the firefighters finally began fighting the fire in earnest, it was too late. Within 90 minutes, the entire north side of Osage Avenue was on fire.
 
Philadelphia's streets are famously narrow, which made it easy for the fire to leap from burning trees on the north side to even more homes on the south side. From there, the flames spilled over to the homes behind 6221 Osage to Pine Street. By evening, three rows of homes were completely on fire, a conflagration so large that the flames could be seen from planes landing at Philadelphia International Airport, more than 6 miles away. The smoke was visible across the city.
 
By the time firefighters brought the under control a little before midnight, 61 houses on that once-tidy block had been completely destroyed. Two hundred fifty people were suddenly, shockingly, without homes. It was the worst residential fire in the city's history.

Growing up, I'd seen Ramona Africa a few times on television being interviewed by reporters during her civil suit against the city. I remembered her as a sleepy-eyed woman with dreadlocks. In 1996, a
