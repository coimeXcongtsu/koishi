In fact, completely depleting Li-ion batteries can cause the cells to enter a protection mode or even damage them permanently. Frequent short discharges are preferable to consistently fully discharging the battery. When charging a Li-ion battery, it's not necessary to "top it off" and in fact, charging cells below 80% of full charge will greatly prolong the life of the battery.

For Trimble data collectors like the TSC3, TSC7 and tablets, we highly recommend removing the battery while storing for long periods of time (14 days or more). It is not recommended to store filed controllers plugged into AC power.
 
Each Trimble GPS / GNSS receiver consumes power at different rates in different scenarios. On average you should expect 2.5 to 3 hours when transmitting as a base station (using internal radio) and 3 to 4 hours when as a rover (with Bluetooth).
 
Due to their high cost, we are often asked to compare genuine Trimble Li-ion battery packs to aftermarket packs that can be found on eBay and Amazon. Like the other equipment manufacturers, Trimble battery packs are manufactured specifically for Trimble in China with very high standards using high-quality cells and protection control circuits. This controlled manufacturing process produces batteries that are safe and reliable which will provide users with hundreds of charge / discharge cycles before they need to be replaced.
 
From our research and experience, you simply can't beat the performance and longevity of a genuine Trimble battery. Yes they are expensive, but not as expensive as loosing a day of work due to dead batteries.
 
There are several battery pack and battery cell manufacturers out there with varying performance and safety standards. Panasonic / Sanyo, LG and Samsung produce high-quality 18650 Li-Ion cells. Better performing cells command higher prices. So much so, that counterfeiters purchase blank 18650 steel tubes and only fill them partially with lower capacity, low cost internals - which results in inferior battery performance, reduce battery life, disregarding safety and environmental standards.

Trimble uses high-quality battery cells in all of their battery packs. You can often feel the weight difference between a genuine Trimble battery and a counterfeit or aftermarket battery which suggest inferior cells are used in the latter.
 
In this article from Battery University: **What Everyone Should Know About Aftermarket Batteries >>,** they point out: "Manufacturers do not object to aftermarket batteries - as long as they are well built and conform to safety standards".
 
It's also important to note that an aftermarket battery is very different from a counterfeit battery. We strongly recommend AVOIDING counterfeit Trimble batteries and chargers commonly found on eBay and Alibaba. Only purchase Trimble batteries from a reputable source.
 
For the R8 and SPS series receivers, we've found success with Kastar brand batteries. The Kastar battery specifications are the same as the older Trimble battery (92600) 7.4V 2.6 Ah, and can be charged with the Trimble dual bay charger (PN: 53018030) as well as Kastars dual bay charger.
 
Cameron Sino produces a replacement battery for the Trimble R10 and R12 receivers at roughly one-third of Trimble's price. We've compared Cameron Sino's TRR100SL battery (PN: 76767 and 990373) against Trimble's 89840-00 and were very happy with the results.
 
The TRR100SL is a 3600mAh vs Trimble's 3700mAh. We tested both batteries in an R10 receiver, which was set up as an RTK base station, tracking all available constellations, transmitting CMRx corrections at .5 Watts (TT450S@4800 bps) through the receivers internal UHF radio. The TR100SL delivered 4.5 hours of uninterrupted runtime while the **Trimble battery only provided an additional 15 minutes.**
 
So why bother? With a 2021 price increase, Trimble's 99511-30 is now $330 compared to only $83 for the Cameron Sino TRS800. Additionally Cameron Sino does stand behind their batteries and have quickly replaced the defective units that we received. They have also been very responsive to our feedback, providing access directly to their engineering team.
 
**Before selling, we test all TRS800 battery packs by running each through two complete charge / discharge cycles.** It's extra effort, but it allows us to find defective batteries up front and get them replaced before they end up in our customers hands.
 
One thing to note about charging the TRS800 with genuine Trimble chargers is; Even when fully charged and healthy, the Trimble charger displays the "Conditioning Required" status. Per conversations with the manufacturer - "This is normal and conditioning is only required when degraded performance is experienced".
 
While we do include used Trimble batteries in some of our GPS systems, we don't recommend buying used batteries. This is because battery capacity decreases slightly with each charge & discharge cycle. Most Li-ion batteries for Trimble products (as well as most consumer products) have a **usable life between 300 to 500 charge / discharge cycles**. A typical survey crew may charge their batteries every shift. For a normal work week - that's five charge / discharge cycles each week, so depending on use, that **could be as many as 260 cycles in a given year** ( 5 cycles per week x 52 weeks).
