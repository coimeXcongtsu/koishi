Somehow I got lucky and got the offer. I still remember to this day how happy I was when I got that full-time offer.

It was one of the most pivotal moments of my career and has led me to where I am today. After graduating from undergrad, I started my career in investment banking, then after a few years, broke into the buyside at a large multi-manager hedge fund, quit that $500K / year job after just one year, and have since worked at a $1Bn+ single manager hedge fund.
 
No doubt the #1 reason I stood out amongst my peers that summer and received the full-time offer was because I started that summer already knowing the basics of Excel, financial modeling and going through basic financial statements.
 
I remember 10+ years ago when I was studying for investment banking interviews, I came across **Wall Street Prep**. It was the best resource I could find to prepare for investment banking and build the skillset I needed to talk in interviews and outperform my peers on the job.
 
**There are a few key topics you need to know before breaking into an investment banking role. Each of these topics are included/covered in depth with the flagship Wall Street Prep course in over 40 hours of lessons divided by subject:**

In every investment banking interview, I guarantee they will ask you a few questions on a DCF. Every single investment bank out there uses a discounted cash flow analysis when it comes to figuring out the true worth of a company. When your client is looking to sell itself or buy another company, a DCF is one of the main analyses you do that you present to the Board when they try to make a decision.
 
Merger math is basically done to understand how a combined company looks after an acquisition/merger compared to on a standalone basis. Managing Directors of banks love to show these analyses in pitch books when they go to client meetings to show management teams potential M&A ideas.
 
Transaction comps are another very common valuation methodology bankers use. Here you learn how to figure out the purchase price and relevant multiples of recently acquired comparable companies, and learn how to applies those to your target company to determine valuation.
 
Depending on what investment banking group you join, LBO modeling may or may not be that important. It is much more relevant when it comes to private equity as everything you do in that industry revolves around building out LBOs.
