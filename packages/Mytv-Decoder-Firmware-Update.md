Lemmy, good job to trying to inform us especially low income countries to at least have a basic knowledge on electronic tech. especially decoders. Please let us together shout our voices on these rampantly sold fake strong decoders. Am a victim of this where recently i bought, i believe now to be a fake one after reading of your invaluable articles. This fake strong decoder srt 4930 has no CN identification and has no SECURITY SYSTEMS in it Menu.
 
@Chisom: you have just to option, 1. try and fix it yourself by reading this article and following the instructions therein -methods-of-reviving-all-brickedfried-dead-strong-decoders/ or take it to your nearest MYTV/Strong dealer

Good morning sir, i was been able to get the rs 232 cable, and i wanted to rise a dead strong receiver SRT 4663X, when i visit the strong site to download its software i only saw SRT4663XV. My question is, can that work for my receiver. And the second is i connected the receiver to my system but when trying to connect, it is asking me to connet and turn ON my receiver and the receiver is dead but the problem is not a power problem. How do i go about it sir. Thank you sir.

Hi Leemy please kindly tell me which other satellites I can receive with my strong 4902 HD decoder from Ghana with my current cccam account coz I have friend currently enjoying NSS 7 W with another type of strong decoder with the same cccam account and another dish abt 60cm. please explain further. thank you
 
you should know that strong decoders and even most decoders are not designed to work only in africa. So what that decoder is trying to tell you is that it has the capacity to open sky HD if and only if all parameters are set right
 
Hi lemmy please I am in ghana and have strong 4902 HD decoder with cccam account since june, 2012 but ever since the dstv upgrade almost all my dstv channels have been off. I only have ss3,mnet action, and mnet premier. I contacted the dealer and he attributed it to the upgrade and promised by 1st October all channels will be back but today is 12th and still no signs of the other channels. I want to know what could be the problem coz my other friends with liberty star have theirs working;
