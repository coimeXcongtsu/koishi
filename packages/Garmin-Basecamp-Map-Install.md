I concurrently downloaded the OSM generic file to copy to the card in my Garmin, but need the detailed maps on my Mac to plan my routes. The global basemap does not have any usable detail for Thailand.
 
Up till I upgraded to el Capitan, i was able to install maps to basecamp on my mac. I tried all the aboveanswers[moderator edit after conversion to comment], but now i'm unable to install the OSM maps on my computer. I wish someone could help,

I have had the same battle for years. Every time I take a 'trip' (yearly) I stress because I cannot load maps from OSM to garmin with mac. I even stumbled onto a OSM thread about my case (my screenshot) from oct 2008...I recognize the setup. STILL can't do it correctly and spend more time than my vacations trying to get it to work. Pretty sad. I can get the gmap, but not the .img...hit and miss. I am about ready to give up on maps and just use my topo that i have.
 
OK. After file is unzipped, create a new folder. Give it the same name as GMAP folder. Move Gmap folder inside new folder. Then add .gmapi to the name of new folder. That will change it to a gmapi file. Double click it and install.
 
This is the answer that worked for me. The new folder can't have an extension in the name because you won't be able to add the .gmap folder if it has one. After putting the .gmap folder into the new folder you created, give that new folder the same name as the .gmap folder but with .gmapi as the extension. As Trint Cole describes :-)
 
You need to download the "osm generic macosx.zip" and this will extract to the file "OSM generic routable(THA\_19-01-2015).gmap" and that when double-clicked will install on the mac using Garmin MapManager.app I think and Basecamp on the Mac will load it fine. It worked for me ok. 
You may have downloaded the Windows or Linux file by mistake or got amongst the "Nullsoft Scriptable Installer script used to create the BaseCamp/MapSource installer." which is probably a Windows thing?
 
I am using el capitain. I have followed the renaming new folders advice above, and still nothing good. Finder simply opens the new folder.gmapi when I double click, Basecamp browser launched from 'Import into My Collections' also simply opens the folder and leaves the 'import' button greyed out. Should I be using a different command from within Basecamp? Do I need anythign else installed on the MAC to make a double click in Finder work? My maps were created by garmin.opensetreemap.nl, and I am using the OSX.zip
 
I finally found a solution. Actually still cannot import directly in basecamp as i used to but......!!!!!! After about a year of no more new OSM maps on my basecamp (mac osx el capitan), I just installed a new map for the first time again. :-)the solution for me is: don't import into basecamp (I stopped trying, none of the above helped me and couldn't find a solution). Instead: paste the map directly into the gps, then connect the gps to the computer and basecamp imports the map from the gps.
 
To unzip the file you just downloaded, right-click on it and choose **Extract Here.** Things may look a bit different if you have WinZip installed. If you see no way to unzip your file, please download and install WinRAR first.
 
If you do not like the appearance of your Garmin or the Freitzeitkarten-OSM maps than you can modify/change the TYP-file associated with the map. For this you should have a look at two important tools: JaVaWa GMTK which allows you to associate a different TYP-File with a map and TYPWiz 6 which allows you to edit an existing TYP-File. At least for me this has opened and whole new world in customizing BaseCamp and make it more useful for my needs.
This is also explained here: -osm.de/garmin/en/design.html There you can find some alternate designs.
 
In my humble opinion the Freitzeitkarten-OSM look very nice in BaseCamp when I use the Topo France V4 TYP-file which I have found here . But each has its own preferences how a map should look like. In the end you can take your time and fully customize the TYP-File to your very own needs until you are happy with the result.
 
First, I will apologize for not being able to find a similar topic to help me through this. I've spent the last hour trying to figure out how to get the "ORTOPO11" map I downloaded from gpsfiledepot.com onto my 62s. I've seen all the outdated tutorials on that website, and then was led to MapsetToolkit that doesn't seem to interact with Basecamp, only Mapsource (which I read has been replaced by Basecamp). I feel like I am missing a big piece of the puzzle here. Maybe it's not as hard as it seems and I am just expecting it to be.
 
IMG files are the final format that your GPS reads. Just put it directly into the Garmin directory on your GPS or SD card. Files with the extension .gmap or .gmapi are installed to basecamp / map manager. Map Install will then create the IMG file when you install to your GPS.
 
Thank you geodarts and mineral2. This is the file/map I am talking about: It has 154 .img files. I can't imagine the uploader envisioned people having to choose between 154 maps on their GPS......right? So now I am back to thinking I have to merge/consolidate/fiddle-with this file to make it work.
 
MapInstall, which is a part of BaseCamp, creates the merged file, up to 4000 .img files. It names the file gmapsupp.img. You can then rename those gmapsupp.img files to AnyName.img and have a dozen or more on the SD card.
 
I've got the "ortopo11" folder in the ....Garmin/Mapinstall/Maps folder, and also tried it in the Garmin/Basecamp/Maps directory....but neither one had Basecamp recognizing it in the "library" on the left of the Basecamp screen.
 
Yes, I read EVERYTHING. What I didn't do was pretend it was 2011 and Windows 8 didn't yet exist. I made the mistake of taking the dated instructions literally, AND not recognizing the real issue was "64bit", not the OS version. Thank you for bringing me back to this.
 
Honestly? Because I didn't want to make yet another login at another website. Plus, It seemed I'd be more likely to find people that have been through this newb stuff here, rather over there, where I get the feeling things are more technical.
 
Sometimes, I think you get better information on this forum than on Garmin's. But you log into the garmin forums using your Garmin account, and unless you haven't registered your device(s), you have a garmin account.
 
I've relied on that Garmin Wiki for years. I asked about the Garmin forums in part because I was once called out on these forums when I made a less-than-flattering comment about the Garmin forums, something to the effect that I found them unfriendly and unhelpful. They might (or might not) be friendlier than when I last visited, but I still can't find any useful information about handheld units, and I wouldn't have any idea where in those forums to ask a question about them.
 
There are a few possibilities to send maps to your GPS Device. As I assume you are using Garmin Basecamp - the easiest is to just send them from Garmin Basecamp. And fastest way of sending is always to the microSD card - in a cardreader - because most Garmin devices devices don't have fast USB chips.
 
Alternatively for Windows users only - you could scroll down to the explications how to send maps with Mapsource - this has the advantage of having a full screen map selection possibility - while the Mapinstall windows to select the tiles is a bit small. Otherwise there are no advantages.
 
**Please note** - you cannot install the maps on the microSD. You always first install the maps to your PC/Mac - then send them - or send a selection of the map. Also note - the maximum number of map tiles your device can read in is around 2000 or 4000 map tiles - so if you install more - some maps simply will not be read in. So as general advice - only send those maps to your device - which you will likely need in near future... (I try to make the map tiles as big as possible - around 13MB average per tile - but other maps - especially older Garmin maps may have tiles of only 1MB)
 
All maps sent at once will appear as one map on your map selection setup on the GPS device. If you want to be able to switch maps on/off separately, then send them once, and rename the GMAPSUPP.IMG into anything else (well the .IMG needs to stay) - but don't use Umlauts, special symbols or spaces in the name. Then just sent the next map. This makes it very easy to manage your maps. You can simply export map by map and rename it. If you want to upload a new updated map, delete the old map you previously sent, and send only the new map again.
