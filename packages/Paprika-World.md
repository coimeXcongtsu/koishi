The seasoning is used to add flavor and color to many types of dishes in diverse cuisines.

Peppers, the raw material in paprika production, originated from North America, where they grow in the wild in Central Mexico and have for centuries been cultivated by the peoples of Mexico. The peppers were later introduced to the Old World, to Spain in the 16th century, as part of the Columbian exchange.[11][12]
 
The plant used to make the Hungarian version of the spice was first grown in 1569. Central European paprika was hot until the 1920s, when a Szeged breeder found a plant that produced sweet fruit, which he grafted onto other plants.[9]
 
Hungary is a major source of paprika,[17] and it is the spice most closely associated with Hungary.[18] The spice was first used in Hungarian cuisine in the early 19th century.[18] It is available in different grades:

The most common Spanish paprika, *pimentn de la Vera*, has a distinct smoky flavor and aroma, as it is dried by smoking, typically using oak wood.[19] Currently, according to the Denomination of Origin Regulation Council (Consejo Regulador de la DOP "Pimentn de La Vera"), the crop of La Vera paprika covers around 1,500 hectares (3,700 acres) and has an annual production of 4.5 million kg (5,000 short tons), certified as Denomination of Origin.[20]
 
Paprika is used as an ingredient in numerous dishes throughout the world. It is principally used to season and color rice, stews, and soups, such as goulash, and in the preparation of sausages such as Spanish chorizo, mixed with meats and other spices. The flavor contained within the pepper's oleoresin is more effectively brought out by heating it in oil.[23]
 
The red, orange, or yellow color of paprika powder derives from its mix of carotenoids.[10] Yellow-orange paprika colors derive primarily from α-carotene and β-carotene (provitamin A compounds), zeaxanthin, lutein and β-cryptoxanthin, whereas red colors derive from capsanthin and capsorubin.[10] One study found high concentrations of zeaxanthin in orange paprika.[24] The same study found that orange paprika contains much more lutein than red or yellow paprika.[24]
 
In a reference serving amount of one teaspoon (2 grams), paprika supplies 6 calories, is 10% water, and provides 21% of the Daily Value of vitamin A.[25] It provides no other nutrients in significant content.
 
From the La Vera region of Spain, this famous smoked paprika has a rich, deep character and authentic smoky flavor. With all the flavor of its more common dulce cousin, this picante version has long been a favorite in our shop. The heat is milder than cayenne, and boasts a bold smokiness.

Recent work on introducing the world's first truly organic growing systems (Ascending Harvest, a Practical Hunger Solution Anyone Can Use), lots of associated tomato talk, and a garden haul inspired the following recipe for Smoked Paprika Tomato Soup.
 
Before you begin preparing this delectable soup, or perhaps as you savor it's splendid homestyle glow, remember we have an opportunity to give hungry families a simple, organic way to grow their own food.
 
Why should people who have everything care what happens to those with nothing? Sharply reminded of people who don't have a choice about what to eat simply because they don't have food, I asked myself: What would our world be like if everyone had enough to eat? By clicking the Green button at Ascending Harvest we can give those families tomatoes and produce of their own so they can make tomato soup of their own.
 
Having spent time in places such as Kenya and Rwanda growing up, I understand African people are much more likely to share a wonderful new way to grow food rather than focus on leveraging its value at market. Why not both?
 
Add milk variant (or light cream) and Puree mixture in a blender until it looks deliciously smooth. Serve and finish with a splash of lime and hot sauce. Smokey paprika brings out the sweet tomatoey tang.
 
Paprika is not only prevalent in Mexican food, it is the national spice of Hungary and is popular around the world, including the Middle East, Europe, and North America. Cultivated around the world, there are many types of paprika on the market today that offer endless opportunities for culinary experimentation.
 
The *Capsicum annuum* plant is a New Word fruit, believed to have originated in Mexico. Based on recent findings, experts believe that the peppers of the plant may have been consumed for thousands of years, making it a categorically ancient spice. In ancient times, paprika was used by indigenous people for culinary reasons and as a red dye for textiles, and is still used as a culinary and textile dyeing agent today.
 
Paprika was introduced to Europe when peppers were brought back to the Old World in the 16th century (according to some accounts by Christopher Columbus himself). When they arrived in Europe, Spanish monks began cultivating the plant. They hung the peppers in smokehouses and dried and ground them into powder in ancient stone mills. Today, some of the best smoked paprika is still made in La Vera, Extremadura (a county in western Spain). In Spain, paprika is sold in variations labeled *dulce* (sweet) *picante* (spicy), *agridulce* (medium) and *pimentn* (smoked).
 
The Turks (of the Ottoman Empire) brought chili peppers to Hungary, where paprika became a cornerstone spice in traditional Hungarian dishes, flavoring staples such as goulash. In the mid 1800s, Hungarians gave paprika the great honor of naming it their National Spice.
 
Paprika is made of the dried and ground skins and flesh of chili peppers, which give the spice its signature red pigment. Although all peppers from the *Capsicum annuum* plant are genetically the same, the appearance of the peppers can vary dramatically from one another .
 
Chili pepper plants are herbaceous perennials that grow best in warm, dry climates. They are leafy plants that grow to about 2.5 feet, and are part of the nightshade family. The fruits of a chili pepper plant are hollow with a smooth, waxy skin that range in shape and size (depending on the variety).
 
I work at a library and I am doing a program on Paprika for adults in November. I was wondering if someone who knows about spices could do a zoom call for my program. I could interview the people or you could do a presentation (about 10-20 minutes). Then answer questions from the audience.
 
My earliest memory of using paprika as a professional cook was on a broiler station in northern Michigan. We broiled a side of Lake Michigan whitefish, an amazing and delicious fish, which was far too large for any one
