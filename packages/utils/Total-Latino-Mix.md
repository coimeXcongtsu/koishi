An estimated 36.2 million are eligible to vote this year, up from 32.3 million in 2020. This represents 50% of the total growth in eligible voters during this time.

Although then-President Donald Trump made gains among Hispanics in 2020, a majority of Latino voters (59%) voted for current President Joe Biden that year, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of validated voters. In presidential elections, turnout rates among Hispanic Americans have typically trailed those of some other groups.
 
As the next presidential election approaches, here are five key facts about Hispanic eligible voters in the United States, based on our own projections for 2024, as well as Census Bureau data for previous years. (Eligible voters in this analysis are defined as citizens ages 18 and older residing in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Not all eligible voters are actually registered to vote. Detailed demographic information about Hispanic eligible voters is available in the drop-down box at the bottom of this post.)
 
This post is one in a series that explores the eligible voter population in the United States in 2024. For this analysis, we examine the detailed demographics and geographic distribution of Hispanic Americans who were eligible to vote in the U.S. in 2022, with projections of the eligible voter population in November 2024.
 
Projections for November 2024 are based on population projections by race, Hispanic origin and nativity developed by the Census Bureau together with data from the American Community Surveys (IPUMS) of 2010-2022. Projected values of the share who are U.S. citizens by age are based on trends drawn from the 2010-2022 American Community Surveys (IPUMS).
 
California and Texas are also the only states where non-Hispanics who are White and no other race make up a plurality, but not a majority, of the eligible voter population (42% in California and 47% in Texas). In both states, Hispanics hold the second-highest share among major racial and ethnic groups.

But the share varies widely by states with a Latino population of 50,000 or more. In New Mexico, 66% of Hispanics are eligible to vote. By contrast, Tennessee (36%) and Maryland (39%) had the lowest percentage of Latinos among eligible voters.
 
Latino immigrants who are not eligible to vote include permanent residents (green card holders) and those in the process of becoming permanent residents; those in the U.S. on temporary visas; and unauthorized immigrants.
 
National Hispanic Heritage Month, which begins in the United States each year on Sept. 15, celebrates U.S. Latinos, their culture and their history. Started in 1968 by Congress as Hispanic Heritage Week, it was expanded to a month in 1988. The celebration begins in the middle of September to coincide with independence days in several Latin American countries: Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica celebrate theirs on Sept. 15, followed by Mexico on Sept. 16, Chile on Sept. 18 and Belize on Sept. 21.
 
As part of our ongoing research about Hispanics in the United States, we analyzed how this group has changed over time using data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The decennial census (PL94-171 census data) provided some historical state and national population counts, and population estimates provided the latest data on total population, births and immigration.
 
We also examined characteristics of the U.S. Hispanic population using the American Community Survey (ACS), which provides data for states and the U.S. on Hispanic origin, language use, country of birth and educational attainment. Data from the 2022 ACS and some from the 2010 ACS are from tabulations released by U.S. Census Bureau. Some ACS and census data is from Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) of the University of Minnesota.
 
**The number of Latinos who say they are multiracial has increased dramatically.** More than 27 million Latinos identified with more than one race in 2022, up from 3 million in 2010. The increase could be due to several factors, including changes to the census form that make it easier for people to select multiple races and growing racial diversity.
 
Six other Hispanic origin groups in the U.S. each have 1 million or more people: Salvadorans, Cubans, Dominicans, Guatemalans, Colombians and Hondurans. In addition, in 2022, Spaniards accounted for nearly 1 million U.S. Latinos.
 
That year, there were about 15.7 million Hispanics in California, up from 14.0 million in 2010. The non-Hispanic White population, the next largest group, declined from 15.0 million to 13.2 million during this time, reflecting a broader national trend.
 
Rounding out the top five states with the largest Hispanic populations were New York (3.9 million) and Arizona (2.4 million). Eight more states had 1 million or more Hispanics: Illinois, New Jersey, Colorado, Georgia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Washington and New Mexico.
 
**The makeup of the U.S. Hispanic population varies widely across major metropolitan areas.**Most of the metro areas in the Midwest, West and South with the largest Hispanic populations are predominantly Mexican. About three-quarters of Hispanics in the Chicago (77%) and Los Angeles (75%) areas identify as Mexican, as do 67% in the Houston area.
 
**Newborns, not immigrants, have driven the recent growth among U.S. Hispanics.** During the 2010s, an average of 1 million Hispanic babies were born each year, slightly more than during the 2000s. At the same time, about 350,000 Hispanic immigrants arrived annually, down substantially from the previous two decades.
 
The recent predominance of new births over immigration as a source of Hispanic population growth is a reversal of historical trends. In the 1980s and 1990s, immigration drove Hispanic population growth.
 
From 2020 to 2022, average annual births among Hispanics were slightly below the previous decade, but immigration decreased considerably, from 350,000 per year to 270,000. Some of this decline can be attributed to immigration into the U.S. stopping almost entirely during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the removal of pandemic-related restrictions, the contribution of immigration to Hispanic growth appears to be returning to early 2010s levels.
 
**The share of Latinos in the U.S. who speak English proficiently is growing.**In 2022, 72% of Latinos ages 5 and older spoke English proficiently, up from 59% in 2000. U.S.-born Latinos are driving this growth: The share of U.S.-born Latinos who speak English proficiently increased by 9 percentage points in that span, compared with a 5-point increase among Latino immigrants. All told, 42.3 million Latinos in the U.S. spoke English proficiently in 2022.
 
Even though the share of Latinos who speak Spanish at home has declined, the number who do so has grown from 24.6 million in 2000 to 39.7 million in 2022 because of the overall growth in the Latino population.
 
The number of Latinos enrolled in college or postgraduate education also increased between 2010 and 2022, from 2.9 million to 4.2 million. Among all U.S. undergraduate and graduate students, the share of Latinos increased from 14% in 2010 to 20% in 2022, slightly higher than the Latino share of the total population.
 
**Four-in-five Latinos are U.S. citizens.**As of 2022, 81% of Latinos living in the country are U.S. citizens, up from 74% in 2010. This includes people born in the U.S. and its territories (including Puerto Rico), people born abroad to American parents, and immigrants who have become naturalized citizens. The Center recently published citizenship rates among Hispanic origin groups for 2021; this data is not yet available for 2022.
 
Language fluency varies among Hispanic subgroups who reside within the mainland United States. 2019 census data shows that 71.1 percent of Hispanics speak a language other than English at home, including 70.4 percent of Mexicans, 58.9 percent of Puerto Ricans, 77.7 percent of Cubans, 86.2 percent of Central Americans. 28.4 percent of Hispanics state that they are not fluent in English.
 
According to 2019 U.S. Census Bureau data, 71.8 percent of Hispanics in comparison to 94.6 percent non-Hispanic whites had a high school diploma or higher. 18.8 percent of Hispanics in comparison to 40.1 percent of non-Hispanic whites had a bachelor's degree or higher. 5.7 percent of Hispanics held a graduate or advanced professional degree, as compared to 15.1 percent of the non-Hispanic white population.
 
According to a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2021 data, 22.9 percent of Hispanics, in comparison to 15.0 percent non-Hispanic whites, worked within service occupations. 24.5 percent of Hispanics in comparison to 42.8 percent of whites worked in managerial or professional occupations. Among full-time year-round workers in 2020, the average Hispanic/Latino median household income was $55,321 in comparison to $74,912 for non-Hispanic white households. In 2020, the unemployment rate for Hispanics was 10.4, as compared to 7.5 for non-Hispanic whites according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that 17 percent of Hispanics in comparison to 8.2 percent of non-Hispanic whites were living at the poverty level.
 
It is significant to note that Hispanics have the highest uninsured rates of any racial or ethnic group within the United States. In 2020, the Census Bureau reported that 49.9 percent of Hispanics had private insurance coverage, as compared to 73.9 percent for non-Hispanic whites. Among Hispanic subgroups, examples of coverage varied: 47.9 percent of Mexicans, 56.3 percent of Puerto Ricans, 57.4 percent
