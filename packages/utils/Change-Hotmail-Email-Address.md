In 2013, Microsoft allowed users to change their primary alias. This meant users had more freedom when managing their online identities. Millions of people have taken advantage of this feature and successfully updated their Microsoft account emails.

Be sure the alternate email or phone is accurate and accessible. Double-check for typos. Finish promptly after receiving the verification code as it may expire. If any issues arise, contact Microsoft support.
 
Verifying is important. It adds an extra layer of security and keeps only authorized users accessing sensitive information related to your account. Take these steps to smoothly complete the verification process for changing your email!
 
Another option: Yahoo Mail Plus, a paid service, allows you to forward emails to a new address. Without it, you would have to create an entirely new email address and keep up on both addresses individually to maintain contact or continue to get emails from your mailing list subscriptions.
 
So, there you have it. While changing your email address comes with some challenges, there are at least a few options or workarounds that make things simpler. Be sure to check out other email organizing hacks, like how to create eye-catching signatures, or when to use encryption, send emails as texts, how to manage spam, and more.
 
I read that revealing your age in your email address isn't in your favor when you're job hunting. Is it possible to change from one email address to another WITHOUT opening a new account and deleting the old one (i.e. [email protected] to [email protected])?I was researching, but I couldn't find any information about it.
 
Your initial email address in Microsoft 365 includes .onmicrosoft.com, like tom@fourthcoffee.onmicrosoft.com. You can change it to a friendlier address like tom@fourthcoffee.com. You'll need your own domain name, like fourthcoffee.com first. If you already have one, great! If not, you can learn how to buy one from a domain registrar.
 
Your initial email address in Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet includes partner.onmschina.cn, like tom@fourthcoffee.partner.onmschina.cn. You can change it to a friendlier address like tom@fourthcoffee.cn. You'll need your own domain name, like fourthcoffee.cn first. If you already have one, great! If not, you can learn how to buy one from a domain registrar.

When you change your domain's email to come to Microsoft 365, by updating your domain's MX record during setup, ALL email sent to that domain will start coming to Microsoft 365. Make sure you've added users and created mailboxes in Microsoft 365 for everyone who has email on your domain BEFORE you change the MX record. Don't want to move email for everyone on your domain to Microsoft 365? You can take steps to pilot Microsoft 365 with just a few email addresses instead.
 
You have yet to explain **why** you cannot edit your current primary email address. You cannot edit any Apple email address used as an AppleID (@icloud.com, @me.com or @mac.com), But you can edit any third party email address you use unless the one you want to use is already in use as a registered AppleID.
 
I have a problem. The email account I used when creating my dropbox account isn't valid anymore. I do remember my password. When I try to log in (as described in the upport section), Dropbox says it sends a code to my invalid emailaddress. Is there a way around this?
 
I am afraid there is not much the Dropbox team can do however, I think there is a workaround. If you still have access to the account via phone, perhaps do a test but I believe if you create another account with a current email address, then use your phone to transfer to the new account. Once verified that all files are over to the new location, then just delete the account. You can do that via phone settings.
 
However, it may be worth sending a Support Ticket as I may be wrong about it or things have changed that I have missed. Fill out this ticket. IT will ask you questions, just be patient and it eventually gets to a page where you can input info. This also helps the DB Team which tech would be most suited for your needs
 
**Did this post not resolve your issue?** If so please give us some more information so we can try and help - please remember we cannot see over your shoulder so be as descriptive as possible!
 
I too have the same problem as others - I try to login to my account to change my email address to my new work email but i get notification that a code has been sent to my email. however, I have moved jobs and can no longer access that email account.
 
And now reading through the community messages - it seems that if we can not access our old email addresses which was used to set up our accounts then we can not get back our accounts. Can you please confirm that this is the case? thank you

I've been trying to find a way to change an email address in O365 for a "shared" user account, lets call it support. The email assigned for that account is showing, lets say "mike@xxxxx". Howeverm the only thing I could change was the "Alternate email"....
 
The on-prem AD is synced with O365/Azure via Azure AD Connect - so I would expect it takes info from on-prem AD. In the O365, when I click on the user and check MAIL tab, there is no email assigned to it.
 
I'm lost here.... how.. or where could I change it please? There is a possibility that the user account was called "mike" originally and was renamed at some point to "support", but not sure.... all ppl working on that are not with the company anymore...
 
Just FYI - when I check the "support" user in Azure AD, there are 3 fields under Contact info: email, alternate email, and proxyaddress. So I expect the proxyaddress will change, ...will see whether also email field will change.
 
My AD isnt syncing the correct info to MS tenant. Any idea how to force a sync for one user? Only one created recently is having this issue, more created the same day no problem, they resolve to the correct domain. @MiSum83

So on my EA Account that is linked to my Xbox Gamertag that has a working GamePass/EA Play subscription on it, is an old email that I've seen deleted it many months ago; it's an old Hotmail account. My Xbox GT is linked to my GMail account. My Xbox GT is linked to my EA Account, but when I sign into my EA Play account via Xbox under my "Customer Portal" and the "About Me" section, it says that the email address for my EA Play account is my old Hotmail account. "Not a big deal," is what I thought, I can just change it, easy peasy.
 
When I clicked on the button to change the email from my old Hotmail, it says the verification code will be sent to me Hotmail account --- the account that doesn't exist anymore so I am literally unable to sign-into it to get the verification code to change the email from my non-existent Hotmail to my Gmail account that's linked to my Xbox GT. I cannot change any information on my EA Play account without that verification code, but the only way to get a verification code is via email, but the email they're sending the verification code to is one that doesn't exist anymore.
 
I'm having a similar issue. My old EA account is linked to my gamer tag. I don't even know when I created an EA account or purchased one of their games, but I must have at sometime. I just purchased a game on XBOX live and when i open the game it tries to connect to my EA account. It tells me that my login has expired and i need to check my email for a verification code. That email is an old AIM email i don't have access to. The recovery email for my old email is my Moms old email that she doesn't have access to. You can't even get customer service for the email provider anymore. there is NO way to get into this email. So as it stands, I can't play the game i purchased or ANY EA game in the future, without creating a new xbox live account.
 
I'm so fed up about this that I literally gave up talking in loops with these people (email communication or chat is outsourced and people talk fully scripted, even the text to calm you down are scripted which makes you more furious).
