For 2.6.4, you can try downloading the VS 2017 runtime installer from MS (here) and installing that standalone first. Ensure you choose the correct bitness of the library for the bitness of Wireshark you're trying to install
 
I rebooted and for some reason Dell Backup and Restore popped up. I don't use it so I uninstalled it, rebooted, installed the WinPcap4.1.3 from the Internet first and then tried to install Wiresharek and it worked. I am now up and running. Thanks so much.
 
The genuine vcredist\_x64.exe file is a software component of Microsoft Visual Studio by Microsoft Corporation.
"VCredist\_x64.exe" is a self-extracting executable file supplied by Microsoft that installs dynamic link library (.DLL) files needed by 64-bit applications created by Microsoft Visual C++, now part of Visual Studio. Visual Studio supplies this file in "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Bootstrapper\Packages\vcredist\_x64\vcredist\_x64.exe", (the version number "v6.0A" may be different), for inclusion in setup files when centrally deploying Visual C++ applications. The version of Visual C++ libraries installed on the target computer to which the application is deployed will be the version present on the machine supplying the "VCredist\_x64.exe" file, unless the installation process finds a newer version resident already. From then on Windows automatically updates these libraries, (if centrally deployed at first). Executing "vcredist\_x64.exe" first creates temporary files in the root directory, ("C:\"). These install the ".dll" libraries in the side-by-side directory, ("C:\windows\winsxs"), where applications expect them. A successful installation should then remove the temporary files from the root.
 
The .exe extension on a filename indicates an executable file. Executable files may, in some cases, harm your computer. Therefore, please read below to decide for yourself whether the vcredist\_x64.exe on your computer is a Trojan that you should remove, or whether it is a file belonging to the Windows operating system or to a trusted application.

Important: Some malware camouflages itself as vcredist\_x64.exe, particularly when located in the C:\Windows or C:\Windows\System32 folder. Therefore, you should check the vcredist\_x64.exe process on your PC to see if it is a threat. We recommend **Security Task Manager** for verifying your computer's security. This was one of the Top Download Picks of The Washington Post and PC World.
 
**Summary:** Average user rating of vcredist\_x64.exe: based on 10 votes with 1 user comment.7 users think vcredist\_x64.exe is essential for Windows or an installed application.3 users think vcredist\_x64.exe is dangerous and recommend removing it.3 users don't grade vcredist\_x64.exe ("not sure about it").
 
A clean and tidy computer is the key requirement for avoiding problems with vcredist\_x64. This means running a scan for malware, cleaning your hard drive using 1cleanmgr and 2sfc /scannow, 3uninstalling programs that you no longer need, checking for Autostart programs (using 4msconfig) and enabling Windows' 5Automatic Update. Always remember to perform periodic backups, or at least to set restore points.
 
Should you experience an actual problem, try to recall the last thing you did, or the last thing you installed before the problem appeared for the first time. Use the 6resmon command to identify the processes that are causing your problem. Even for serious problems, rather than reinstalling Windows, you are better off repairing of your installation or, for Windows 8 and later versions, executing the 7DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth command. This allows you to repair the operating system without losing data.
 
To help you analyze the vcredist\_x64.exe process on your computer, the following programs have proven to be helpful: ASecurity Task Manager displays all running Windows tasks, including embedded hidden processes, such as keyboard and browser monitoring or Autostart entries. A unique security risk rating indicates the likelihood of the process being potential spyware, malware or a Trojan. BMalwarebytes Anti-Malware detects and removes sleeping spyware, adware, Trojans, keyloggers, malware and trackers from your hard drive.
 
Vcredist\_x64.exe is a software file component of Microsoft Visual C developed by Microsoft. It is a legitimate program, usually known as Microsoft Visual C++ x64 Redistributable Setup. Put simply, vcredist\_x64.exe is the file responsible for running Microsoft Visual C++ in the Visual Studio.
 
The redistributable Visual C++ packages help several other Microsoft Visual applications to function properly. This happens when a user installs the respective packages separately from the applications. Visual C++ allows several applications in the PC to use the same visual package without installing it again.

**If your PC is running into errors and appears to be suspiciously slow, it needs maintenance. Download the Outbyte PC Repair tool for Windows to help you resolve common computer performance issues.
 
Its occurrence means that the version of Microsoft Visual C++ on your PC is corrupted, missing, or outdated. When this happens, you will also encounter errors with the apps that rely on Microsoft Visual C++. For example, your Origin Thin setup will probably encounter an error or fail to load due to the missing vcredist-x64-exe. You will also have problems running Outlook, Skype, and online games that call upon the Visual C++ package.
 
Your hard drive often fills up from time to time, and when that happens, Windows runs slower. Disk Cleanup tool can help you get rid of temporary files that Windows no longer needs and are just using up space.
 
Some tools, installations, or malware may damage or impersonate Windows system files. According to users who have experienced this problem, SFC examines any activity log, stored in the Windows folder as \Logs\CBS\CBS.log. This will fix the credist\_x64.exe error
 
The Microsoft System Configuration Utility can help resolve problems that occur when Windows starts up. It can allow you to disable services and startup programs to eliminate the possible causes or errors. To run the command msconfig:
 
Ensure that your PC has essential Windows updates installed automatically. You may need to change settings on the Windows Update Client (wuauclt) to be certain. To run the wuauclt /ShowWindowsUpdate command, follow these instructions:
 
I've been deploying the Windows 10 build 1607 feature upgrade (also known as the Anniversary Update) via WSUS to a test lab at work. The machines are upgrading from 1511. Today I was informed that Autodesk 3ds Max & AutoCad would not launch on those machines. 3dsmax.exe gave an error: "The procedure entry point \_\_crtCreateSymbolicLinkW could not be located in the dynamic link library C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\MSVCP110.dll."
 
It seems like the in-place upgrade breaks the installed MS VC++ 2012 libs by replacing them with weird versions. The only evidence I can find online is KB3119142 from January 2016 which specifically mentions this sort of error with Windows 10. That update supposedly fixes the issue, but there's a lot of griping online about that update causing problems. I can't find that update on my WSUS server, so I'm not sure if it's even available for or applicable for Windows 10 build 1607. It you have any idea on that one, please let me know! The KB article recommends running a repair install to fix the issue. I can work with that.
 
To fix the issue, I created an immediate scheduled task which runs the Visual C++ Redist Installers in repair mode. I used a WMI filter on my Group Policy Object to make the task run only on Windows 10 build 1607 machines.
 
Create a GPO which creates an immediate scheduled task. Create a folder on the network available to your machines with the redistributable installers from the link above: vcredist\_x86.exe, and vcredist\_x64.exe. Create an action to run vcredist\_x86.exe /repair /quiet /norestart and then vcredist\_x64.exe /repair /quiet /norestart to repair the installation. Technically a reboot is needed to complete the install, but the issue is resolved without a reboot. I elect to not reboot because I figure the machines will reboot eventually and I don't want to interrupt someone using the machine.
 
Since I want this to only run on Windows 10 1607. I needed the following WMI filter on my GPO. Namespace root\CIMv2 with the query Select BuildNumber from Win32\_OperatingSystem WHERE BuildNumber = 14393 does the job.
