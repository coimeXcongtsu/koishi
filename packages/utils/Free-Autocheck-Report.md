Here are just a few sample AutoCheck reports and glossary terms that show a cross section of possible vehicle history event detail. If you'd like more detail, you may view additional sample reports and a complete list of glossary terms.
 
Reported accidents or damage events are a result of vehicle collisions or other non-collision incidents such as vandalism or theft. Not all accidents or damage events are reported to AutoCheck. Certain accident or damage events are reported by the source to have resulted in minor, moderate or severe damage to the vehicle, or the events are calculated by AutoCheck to have resulted in minor, moderate or severe damage based on the information reported. It is recommended to have pre-owned vehicles inspected by a third party prior to purchase.
 
Words or symbols on the vehicle's official title issued by the state DMV that signify the vehicle's status or condition. Examples of brands include, junked, salvaged, lemon, rebuilt or reconstructed vehicles; flood, hail, or fire damaged vehicles; totaled vehicles; vehicles with odometers that have been rolled back or exceed mechanical limits; stolen or abandoned vehicles.
 
A salvage vehicle is a vehicle that has been wrecked or damaged beyond repair; declared a total loss by the insurer; or declared a total loss by reason of theft. When an insurance company as a result of a total loss settlement acquires a vehicle, the insurance company must apply for a Salvage Certificate. If the owner retains possession of a salvage vehicle, the owner must obtain a Salvage Certificate before receiving a total loss statement from the insurance company.

Yes, but it depends on the information you're looking for. If you want to check for any open recalls, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's VIN lookup tool is free to use. If you're simply looking to decode your VIN to find out where it was made and other pieces of trivia, take a look at this article on Edmunds. Finally, if you need a full vehicle history report, you'll have to either find a used car on a dealership website or pay for the report yourself.
 
Vehicle history reports are an integral part of any used car purchase. Reports from services such as AutoCheck, Bumper and Carfax shed light on a car's backstory and can alert you to potential problems or inconsistencies before you hand over your money. Each has its strengths and blind spots, so below we'll look at how to maximize your time and investment. With the cost of a single Carfax report at $45, a single AutoCheck report at $25, and a monthly subscription to the newer service Bumper at $23 (after a seven-day trial), it's imperative you know what kind of information you're getting with each.
 
A vehicle history report can usually tell us whether a car has been in an accident or possibly given a "branded" title, a broad category of titles indicating extensive damage. Branding means an insurance company has declared the vehicle a total loss because of an accident, flood damage or other catastrophic event. A salvage title is one example, issued when a car has been damaged seriously enough in a crash to warrant writing it off rather than pay to fix it.
 
The car's vehicle identification number (VIN) is the key to the vehicle history report. The 17-digit VIN is like the car's Social Security number: It's used to note nearly every major event in an auto's lifetime. Typically, the information on a vehicle history report includes a summary and an overall evaluation of the vehicle, supported with details, dates and locations. The report makes it easy to see if the car has been registered in numerous states. Other information can include a description of the vehicle, the number of previous owners, accident information, verification of recent mileage (which could include an alert for an odometer rollback), and lemon-law and recall checks. For definitive information on recalls for any used car that you're considering, use the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's free VIN lookup tool.
 
Several companies sell vehicle history reports, promising to reveal the past of any given vehicle. Keep in mind no report is perfect. It's only as good as the incidents that have been reported to the database. If someone gets into a minor accident and chooses to repair the car without involving an insurance company (rates often rise after making a claim), the accident will not be reflected in the report.
 
Similarly, if the body shop handling the repairs does not share its data with the vehicle history companies, it won't appear on a report either. A vehicle could have frame damage and you wouldn't know it by just reading the report. That said, we still recommend running a report before driving across town to see a car in person.
 
The reports from the biggest players, AutoCheck and Carfax, are expensive, ranging from $25 for one report to $100 for five. And if you're shopping for a used car on the private-party market, you'll likely be paying for the reports yourself. Shopping at a car dealership is a different story. Most major used car dealers and some car-selling sites will provide a free Carfax report or AutoCheck report. You can find many of these vehicles on the Edmunds used car inventory page or on dealership websites.
 
If you find yourself on the used car lot and want to know the history of a particular vehicle, ask for a report. All dealers have vehicle history report subscriptions, usually with AutoCheck or Carfax, and will run a free report for interested buyers. This report becomes a valuable source of third-party information. If the dealer refuses to run a vehicle history report or provides an outdated report, it's a possible red flag.
 
The Carfax report is the benchmark for all other vehicle history reports. If a vehicle has had multiple owners, the information is clearly labeled and organized in different sections. Carfax also has more detailed maintenance records, information that can inform what issues a vehicle might have had. It's also an indicator that a prior owner took good care of the vehicle.
 
We ran a report on a 2008 Lexus ES 350 that spent its life in Texas. Carfax had 25 service records, including one to replace the drive belts. That's an expensive repair and good to know about as a buyer. AutoCheck only had four service records and did not have the information on the drive belts.
 
AutoCheck's scale isn't zero to 100, which can be confusing. We ran the VIN of a 2015 Honda Civic, and it received a score of 82. Sounds like a good car, right? But this Civic was in a major accident, d
