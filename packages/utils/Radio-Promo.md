For any of you who use xm radio like myself. I found this promo and have used it on all 3 of my lease vehicles. I paid 71 for whole year plus got a 3 free echo Dots. Existing customers also are eligible. I had 4 months left on current promo and was able to renew for 12 month promo. You can get to website and use the text feature and tell them you want this promo.
 
Be careful with the fine print. Lots of complaints with Sirius that is well documented. They lure you into this promo - take down your CC info, and once your promo is over they hit you full rate of 21.95 per month.

Then after you sign up for this promo they spam you with calls nonstop and emails (even after you request to have your contact info taken off their sales communications). Highly malignant sales practices.
 
Sirius/XM is having a tough time competing with phone-enabled streaming services like Pandora and Spotify in your car. They used to have the only vehicle service going but lately have much competition.
 
To each his own. There is something to be said about the simplicity of having xm available without downloading, streaming, bluetoothing, plugging in an additional device. And I actually enjoy the xm DJs.

What I described above for a number of great clients including the Concord Label Group, Signature Sounds, Compass Records, Mascot Provogue, Rock Ridge Music, ADA and many more, including some great independent releases which have recently included Jeffrey Foucault, Caitlin Canty, Kaia Kater, Dori Freeman and Mo Kenney.
 
**Who are your favorite artists from any genre and what artist define Americana music for you ?**
Lowell George and Little Feat, The Band, John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters and Howling Wolf, Alan Wilson, Ronnie Bowman, Clifton Chenier, Fats Domino, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Bill Monroe, Flatt and Scruggs, Mose Allison, and Glenn Gould, to name a few. Probably if I had to pick just one that represents Americana music more than any other it would have to be four Canadians and a pretty great drummer from Arkansas, The Band.
 
I hope that we continue to see some stations evolve like WEXT in Albany to a hybrid Triple A, playing a lot of new roots music and at the same time the standard bearers like KRSH, KPIG, KHYI, KNBT, WDVX, KVMR continue to find support in their local communities. Also I hope that there continues to be great specialty radio like Jerry Treacy at WFDU, Mary Tilson at KPFA, Cousin Kate at WZBC and all the great blues shows across the country and the new shows like Luke Church at WVTF Roanoke. I also thank all the internet operators who do all this for almost nothing and hope everyone keeps doing it so I have something to listen to.

That led to as radio does leads to multiple radio jobs over the course of time. In 2000, I moved to North Carolina with intentions on finding a job in the industry cause they had according to the booklet I had, they had a YepRock records, sugar hill records, red eye distribution, a mammoth records was there at the time.
 
And then they asked me to come back and train their first replacement. I did that. He got another job doing booking. So then they asked me to train the next person I did that they immediately went back to college. I think it was. So then after the third time they were just like you just do our radio.

A **promo** (a shorthand term for **promotion**) is a form of commercial advertising used in broadcast media, either television or radio, which promotes a program airing on a television or radio station/network to the viewing or listening audience. Promos usually appear during commercial breaks, although sometimes they appear during another program.
 
Promos typically run from 15 to 60 seconds, with 30-second spots being the most common, although some occasionally last run as little as five seconds or as long as 90 seconds. Most promos show select video or audio clips of scenes or segments from an upcoming program (such as a television or radio series, film or special). Some television promos (particularly for an upcoming television series) utilize a monologue format in which a star or host of the program breaks the fourth wall, which is often done in a humorous and/or parodical manner. Most radio promos utilize this format as well, with a host of the program discussing the show itself, though some feature audio clips from past editions of the radio broadcast. Broadcast television stations promote upcoming newscasts by featuring teases of select story packages to be featured in the broadcast, such as an investigative report or a special-interest feature segment.[1]
 
The airdate and time of the program's broadcast as well as the name and/or logo of the station or network that the program will be broadcast on are displayed either at the end of or throughout the promo (in the latter case, the airtime and network/station may be displayed before it is mentioned verbally by the announcer). Until the mid-1980s on broadcast television stations, the text showing the date and time, along with the station logo were displayed on the bottom of the screen (unlike with broadcast and cable television, airtime information is not pre-displayed on promos for syndicated programs as syndicated programs are typically aired at different times depending on the market, and are instead inserted by the station itself); however, stations now posterize graphics over the tail end of a syndicated program promos where the program's logo is shown (many stations use this treatment on promos for programs airing on networks that the station maintains an affiliation, such as Fox and The CW) or show the latter portion of the promo within a box surrounded by the graphic.
 
Premium cable channels and other television networks that do not accept outside advertising traditionally only air promos during pre-determined breaks that start after a program concludes; the length of these breaks can vary depending on the start time of the succeeding program, it is feasible for multiple program promotions to be shown within the break until the start of the next program.Types of promotional media:-1) television2) radio3) internet4) billboards5) newspapers, magazines6) pamphlets7) SMS8) brochures9) word of mouth
 
An ad in the lower third of a TV screen during a show helps to remind people what network they are watching. Called a snipe, this type of promotion targets people, especially younger people, who are used to seeing such items when they look at computer screens or cell phones. Some people have criticized the practice because it is distracting, and in some cases such ads cover up subtitles and prevent information from being seen. In some cases, the additional information can help people understand a story, but in others, too much information can interfere with communication.[2]
 
Players can upgrade the Promotion level by tapping on the upgrade icon > **Restaurant Promo** tab in the speaker. This upgrade can unlock new customers from the village, town and the city as well as a few Special Customers. There are 4 levels of promotion:
 
Effects will stack with those of the same effect type previously purchased. Up to 3 effects will be offered at a time. Once an effect is purchased, the next level effect will be offered to be purchased. Players can see the current promotion effects by tapping on the question mark icon in the speaker.
 
In general, the terms used to describe different applications of promo are loosely defined. They refer, in a broad sense, to elements of the promo including the content, what exactly is being promoted, when the promo is being played in the broadcast, and/or the duration of the promo ad.
