The Netflix series "The Queen's Gambit" is arguably the best depiction of the tournament chess scene ever put on film. The series was produced and realised by Scott Frank and Allan Scott, and is based on Walter Tevis' novel of the same name. "The Queen's Gambit" was released in 2020 and is one of the most successful Netflix series ever.
 
Anya Taylor-Joy did an outstanding job of portraying the main character Beth Harmon, who grew up as an orphan, learned chess at the orphanage and rises to become a world-class player, but also has to struggle with her addiction to pills and alcohol.

In one scene, the progress of a tournament is told in a fast and original way. On the one hand, the pace is set by the intelligent use of fast-changing frames, a technique that was popular in the 1960s, for example in the famous Steve McQueen film "The Thomas Crown Affair". But it is also the lively background music that sets the pace.
 
Wait a minute, "The Thomas Crown Affair", isn't that a film in which chess also plays a role? That's right! The film contains a famous scene in which Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway start to play chess as a prelude to a double-edged and passionate love affair.
 
Mason Williams was born in Texas in 1938. He studied music in Oklahoma City and only learned to play the guitar during his studies. During his military service he earned money by composing pieces. One of his compositions was "Cinderella Rockefella", which was later successfully performed by Esther and Abi Ofarim. Petula Clark was also one of Williams' clients.
 
In 1967, Williams began writing for the TV comedy duo Tom and Dick Smothers. Through the show, Williams got a contract with Warner Brothers and in 1968 he wrote the instrumental piece "Classical Gas", for which he received three Grammy Awards in 1969.

The piece was written one weekend after a long tour with the Smothers Brothers. Williams later said that he was looking forward to playing the guitar and wanted to write a piece that would be a kind of "fuel" for the guitar, hence the name "Classical Gas".

One of the most talked-about shows recently has been The Queen's Gambit. The Netflix limited series followed an orphan girl named Beth Harmon (Anya Taylor-Joy) who becomes one of the most talented chess players in the world while also battling her own demons.
 
While chess is not usually a topic of mainstream interest, the series has captured the attention of audiences everywhere. It is a gripping character study of a tortured genius as well as a thrilling depiction of the game of chess. Though only seven episodes in total, The Queen's Gambit delivered many unforgettable scenes.
 
Mr. Shaibel is a reserved man who is not overly friendly, but he agrees to teach Beth the game. Before long, Beth beats her teacher and he tells her that not only is she better at it than he is, but she is quite extraordinary. It is this simple compliment that pushes Beth forward into her true calling.
 
Mr. Shaibel recognizes how amazing a talent like Beth is, especially at such a young age, so he does what he can to help encourage those skills. He contacts a man with a local chess association who invites Beth to participate in a game at the local school.
 
In reality, Beth is being invited to play against the entire school chess team simultaneously. The all-boys team is not too impressed when a girl shows up to compete with them, but Beth doesn't sweat at all as she effortless defeats each and every one of them.
 
After years of growing up in the orphanage, Beth is finally adopted by a middle-aged couple, the Wheatleys. Though Mr. Wheatley is a stern man who seems totally indifferent to his new daughter, Mrs. Wheatley is happy to have Beth for company.
 
Eventually, Mr. Wheatley leaves them both. Instead of surrendering to depression at abandonment, the two women form a closer bond and become determined to move forward together. It's the beginning of a truly touching relationship.
 
Though her parenting styles are a bit unorthodox, Mrs. Wheatley proves to be a caring maternal figure whom Beth eventually comes to regard as her mother. Mrs. Wheatley also encourages Beth's chess playing as she becomes more renowned.
 
Win or lose, Mrs. Wheatley is always there to comfort Beth after a match. Following her first defeat to Russian champ Borgov, Beth comes back to the hotel room to find Mrs. Wheatley dead and herself alone once again.
 
One of the compelling things about Beth Harmon as a character is that no matter how much heartbreak and tragedy she suffers, she always keeps her head up high and stands up for herself. Following the death of Mrs. Wheatley, Mr. Wheatley comes back to claim the house.
 
One of the most important relationships Beth forms in her career is with Benny Watts, a young American player who is already established on the scene. During one of their first tournaments together, Benny challenges Beth to a game of speed chess for five dollars a game. He wins again and again.
 
Of course, Beth is not one to let embarrassment like that go unanswered. Years later, Beth is visiting Benny in New York. To prove she is now better than he is, she challenges him to a speed chess rematch while simultaneously playing two other boys. She wins all her money back and then some.
 
The thrill of seeing Beth triumph in the world of chess is balanced with the dread of seeing her sink deeper into an addiction to pills and alcohol. She eventually closes herself off from everyone around her and falls into a devastating downward spiral.
 
It is a tough sequence to watch as it seems like Beth is throwing her life away. But Taylor-Joy's performance and Scott Frank's direction make sit such a brilliant montage of destruction, especially with the final flashback of Beth's real mother saying, "That's my girl."
 
Beth is pulled out of her spiral when she is visited by Jolene, her friend from the orphanage. Jolene brings word that Mr. Shaibel passed away and the two return to their former home to attend his funeral.
 
In a beautiful moment, Beth goes into the basement where she used to play chess with Mr. Shaibel. There she finds a collection of newspaper and magazine clippings all following Beth's success throughout the years, showing Mr. Shaibel's pride in his student's success.
 
One of the biggest things weighing Beth down is the feeling that she is not wanted. As such, she pushed away many good people in her life over the fear of being abandoned. However, in her most important moment, they prove that they never went anywhere.
 
When in Russia to face Borgov for the world championship, Beth reunites with her old friend Townes. The morning of the match, Townes hands her the phone as all of her chess friends are on the other end giving her encouragement before the big match.
 
In her previous matches against Borgov, Beth felt inadequate. She left defeated and humiliated. But in their final showdown in Borgov's own country, something changed in Beth and how the world perceived her.
 
Borgov was nervous about playing her, the other champions revered her, and she was the true threat in this tournament. She enters the final game with a clear mind and, as she does when she is under the influence, she sees the game and its possibilities playing out on the ceiling. As everyone looks up to see what she is looking at, it becomes clear no one sees the game the way she does. With that, her victory is assured.

Back in 1993 I was lucky enough to be invited to attend the PCA World Chess Championship match between Gary Kasparov and Britain's Nigel Short at the Savoy Theatre in London. Sponsored by The Times and broadcast live by Channel 4 and the BBC - it grabbed the nation's attention and seemed to inject new energy into the game. As in The Queen's Gambit tournament scenes, the Savoy Theatre was crammed with experts analysing every move on oversized boards in every available room away from the main stage. Those were the days - Breakfast at Simpson's On The Strand followed by a day of watching two of the world's best chess players compete in the perfect surroundings of The Savoy.
 
When I heard that The Queen's Gambit was driving new interest in chess I tried to come up with my own list of films and TV shows that featured chess. I got to this list surprisingly (worryingly) quickly. Some are really obvious - but some are not. I'll apologise in advance for the Knight Moves trailer. I have no idea why that popped into my head as a classic chess movie.
 
It's fascinating to see how chess is used to build characters in film and TV. Often used as a character short-hand for cold intellect or ambition, it has also been linked to death, a serial killer's MO, and one of the most beautifully intimate scenes in any movie. Ever. (see #1 below). Spot a chess board - ideally with the pieces indicating a long-distance match s
