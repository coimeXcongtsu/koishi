Fikerte Kidanemariam was the assistant to the Ethiopian ambassador in Washington, D.C., when I met her during the summer of 2009. I talked with her and other embassy personnel about Ethiopian cuisine, but she was the culinary sage and scholar of the group, and her sister is married to Daniel Mesfin, the author of Exotic Ethiopian Cooking, the very good Ethiopian cookbook.

Marthe van der Wolf wrote a vivid piece in 2012 for the Mail & Guardian, a South African newspaper, in which she recalled her years of living in Ethiopia, where she learned how to make doro wot from an expert.
 
In a large pot, begin to cook the onions without adding any niter kibe (Ethiopian spiced butter). Stir them constantly to keep them from burning. When they begin to get a bit dry, add a little water to moisten them. Keep doing this as they cook.
 
When your doro wot is done, serve it on injera with the vegetable side dishes of your choice. Be sure to scoop a lot of the kulet onto the chicken and injera: It will be rich, spicy and delicious, practically a meal in itself.
 
And by the way, if you are starting from scratch, slaughtering your own chicken and cutting it up, your 12 parts will be two breasts, two thighs, two legs, the back, the neck, and the wings divided to create two parts from each.
 
Ethiopian doro wat is a spicy stewed chicken dish that is a classic of East African cuisine. This recipe is how I used to make doro wat when I worked as a cook at the Ethiopian restaurant Horn of Africa many years ago.

I used to make injera at the restaurant in much the same way as in**this injera recipe**, so if you want the real deal, follow that one; it takes a few days because injera is a sourdough flatbread.
 
The most important ingredient in doro wat other than the meat is berbere, a complex spice mix that, like curry, is different wherever you go. Here is **my recipe for berbere**, which is close, but not exactly the same, as the berbere we used at the Horn of Africa.
 
In Ethiopia, there is a tradition of dry cooking onions before adding any fat. I was skeptical at the restaurant, but my boss, Meselesh Ayele, convinced me right away. Dry cooking onions concentrates flavor and reduces water in a dish. It matters.
 
Made this recipe and have to say one if the better non Indian curries ive made. Very tasty and the addition of boiled eggs seems odd but does add a creamy element.
Thanks for showing me something new.
 
I have tried so many of your recipes and they all turned out delicious.
I have also bought all but one of your books and only because it was sold out at the time.
You are an amazing cook and I am loving it that you utilize everything on an animal.
My father, who just passed away last year was also an excellent game cook, but he took many of his recipes to the grave, because he lived in Germany and I live here so we did not get to see each other as often as I would have liked (I owned a restaurant for nearly 30 years).
But your recipes sure sound a lot like his.
Thank you I am enjoying all of them.
 
These 12 pieces of meat are then thoroughly cleaned in a large bowl of water and lemon juice. In this doro wat recipe, I did clean the chicken in the traditional way but probably not as well. I also missed out purchasing and preparing a live chicken.
 
**Mekelesha:** A spice blend that is similar to many garam masalas out there. In fact, I usually just use my own garam masala and add a little nutmeg to it.This is a blend of cardamom seeds, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, cumin and nutmeg.
 
**Niter kebbeh:**Homemade spiced ghee. It is usually made with butter that is then cooked over a low heat to separate the solids and become clarified butter. I usually use ghee to save time.
 
My vegan version of the classic Ethiopian favorite Doro Wat is a labor of love. It took me upwards of two hours to put together which, to a speed-seeking cook like me, is an eternity and an indulgence.
 
But this is an indulgence I had long craved. There's something about the very look of this ravishing, flaming-red dish that stokes my appetite, not to mention the aroma. Doro Wat is often called Ethiopia's national dish and just inhaling that spice-rich aroma reveals just why it's so popular. Traditionally it's made with chicken, but it's not a hard dish to veganize because all those spices and flavors in there are perfect with "meaty" vegetables like mushrooms or eggplants.
 
Cooking Ethiopian dishes like this and especially lentil-based dishes like misir wot or shiro wot is always a pleasant revelation to me, both as a cook and as someone who cooks a lot of Indian food. That's because Ethiopian cuisine couldn't be more similar to Indian cuisine in its use of spices, yet it couldn't be more different in technique, and the end results are worlds apart. To put it more simply, an Indian curry contains a lot of the same spices and ingredients that a Doro Wat does, but because you cook them so differently they taste vastly different.
 
Doro Wat has two flavor building blocks: niter kibbeh, which is butter spiced with garlic, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon, and berbere, a powdered mix of chillies and more spices (there are paste versions of this too). For this recipe I use my wonderful vegan niter kibbeh, made with heart-healthy olive oil. Don't try to take a short cut and leave out either the niter kibbeh or the berbere because your Doro Wat will then taste like its missing something, which is never a kind thing to do to your tastebuds.
 
The most tedious part of this recipe was, to me, roasting a pile of onions to a rich brown color with the help of nothing but a little water-- it took over an hour. I toned down the heat in this dish because Desi, despite his Indian tastebuds, cannot tolerate too much chilli. If you are a heat-seeker, go ahead and use more red chillies.
 

I used this recipe with eggplant with spectacular results. Really loved the two flavor-base method! It really makes a difference. Restaurant quality stuff! I am NOT a vegan, but could easily eat vegan meals like this all day. Thanks so much for this darn fine recipe.
 
My goodness, thank you so much for this recipe. I'm half Ethiopian and just became a vegetarian and was googling vegan doro wat. What a treat to find this jewel of a website! I appreciate you sharing this recipe and just signed up to your newsletter! Many blessings
 
This recipe looks very interesting! I plan to try it with a few modifications. Just wanted to point out that real Ethiopian doro wot does not contain tomato of any kind (fresh, paste, or otherwise). Although it is typical to find tomato in western recipes or restaurants whose patrons are mostly non-Ethiopian. The color comes from the berbere that is added.
 
I love Ethopian food but I have not much since my disaster to make injra! This sure looks yummy, I wished I had quality time to make this some day. With my 2 year old, I tend to go with tried and quick food.
