Bridging North America recognizes the importance of partnering with local stakeholders, businesses, professional associations, unions, First Nations and educational institutions for the Gordie Howe International Bridge project. These partnerships will help to strengthen the local economy, create jobs and training, and ensure the success of the project during its design, construction and operation.
 
With a focus on workforce, training and pre-apprenticeships/apprenticeships, this strategy will ensure opportunities for local workforce development and training occur on both sides of the border and will leverage existing local resources to maximize the opportunities for Windsorites, Detroiters and First Nations.
 
The Gordie Howe International Bridge project will create jobs on both sides of the border during construction and many permanent jobs in the operation of the crossing. As well, it is expected that thousands of jobs will be created in businesses that will supply goods and raw materials for the project.
 
Bridging North America anticipates the creation of 2,500 jobs including direct hires, sub-contractors and seconded individuals, as well as significant economic benefits that extend to the whole region.
 
There will be many jobs for skilled and experienced construction trade workers such as: operating engineers, labourers, carpenters, electricians, landscapers, equipment operators, and truck drivers. There will be business opportunities for local haulage companies and suppliers (i.e. cement, piping, etc), as well. Other employment opportunities will be available for engineering, accounting, quality control, safety, project control and finance.
 
The Gordie Howe International Bridge Project Quality and Environmental Management Systems are applicable to all BNA sites and offices, and shall encompass all of the project work, including design, construction, traffic management, environmental work, interim OM work, OMR work, rehabilitation work and handback work. However, at this stage of the project, the scope of the ISO 9001:2015 QMS and 14001:2015 EMS Certifications are related to the design, construction, traffic management and environmental work.

In today's competitive world, securing reliable, high-quality metal is crucial for your success. That's where ISO certification steps in, offering a powerful guarantee of excellence in every aspect of a supplier's operation. It's not just a label; it's a badge of trust that ensures your projects get the metal they deserve.
 
Think of ISO certification as a stamp of approval. It means an independent organization has verified that a company's internal systems, like manufacturing processes or service procedures, meet internationally recognized standards for quality and consistency.
 
And the best part? There's an ISO certification for just about everything! From quality management (like the well-known ISO 9001) to environmental sustainability and cybersecurity, these standards help businesses improve efficiency, minimize risks, and ultimately, deliver better products and services.
 
ISO stands for the International Organization for Standardization, an independent, non-governmental organization that develops and publishes international standards. It's responsible for setting the bar for quality management systems worldwide.
 
This number refers specifically to quality management standards. The ISO 9000 family covers various aspects of quality management, and 9001 focuses on best practices for efficiency, effectiveness, and customer satisfaction.
 
These four digits represent the year the current version of the standard was published. ISO regularly updates its standards, and ISO 9001:2015 is the fifth edition released in September 2015. Mead Metals has updated its processes to meet the specifications of this newest version.
 
Our ISO-certified quality guarantees rigorous standards are applied at every stage, from sourcing materials to delivering finished products. This translates to consistent quality and reliability you can depend on.
 
When you choose Mead Metals, you choose a partner dedicated to exceeding industry benchmarks. Our ISO certification is a tangible symbol of our unwavering commitment to quality and customer satisfaction.
