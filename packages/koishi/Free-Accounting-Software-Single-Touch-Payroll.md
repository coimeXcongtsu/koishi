In Phase 1 of STP, Year-to-date gross income amounts were reported to the ATO via pay and update events. Phase 2 extends the use of this data to other government agencies such as the Department of Social Services, Services Australia (Child Support and Centrelink) and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Because these agencies assess income differently, the disaggregation (separate itemisation) of gross income amounts will provide more accurate and relevant employment income information to them. The following components of gross earnings will be disaggregated:

With STP2, employers must declare whether an employee is a volunteer, labour-hire, casual, part-time or full-time. If employers employ Australian residents to work overseas, they will need to report details regarding the host country. With STP2, employers must report each component of income rather than the gross sum, itemising; overtime, commissions, salary sacrifice, bonuses, paid leave, and allowances.
 
STP Phase 2 has introduced the ability to report on child support garnishees and deductions through STP. Reporting through STP will remove the need for employers to provide separate remittance advice to the Child Support Registrar. If you choose to not report through STP then there is no preparation required to be Phase 2 ready in this area, however employers will still need to report directly to the Child Support Registrar on an ongoing basis.
 
Single Touch Payroll was an ATO initiative introduced in 2018 to streamline payroll reporting, however there are further STP changes (Phase 2) coming into effect from January 2022 that primarily relate to further reporting details provided to the ATO.

According to the ATO, small employers with 19 or fewer employees should already be reporting Single Touch Payroll. Micro employers with less than 4 employees can report quarterly through their registered tax or BAS agent.
 
For Single Touch Payroll Phase 2 - the focus is around the expansion of reporting details rather than the STP lodgement process itself, so most employers won't need to change the way they currently lodge their STP reports. We will be in touch with our customers closer to the date to confirm changes or requirements.

\* PayPal and QuickBooks customers get paid on average in less than 5 days, which is over 7 days faster than the average for invoices that get paid with other payment methods. Data is for paid invoices that were created in QuickBooks in Australia between 23.05.22 and 23.11.22
 
. A combination of the Payslip summary, Deductions and Contributions Summary would be greatly appreciated. At the moment I have to pull up three reports to complete the IRD Employer monthly schedule. A detailed payslip report would simplify this process.
 
Hi,
I was just wondering if there was any further work on Single Touch Payroll. Is there a way of manually submitting the information required by the ATO? The due date for single touch payroll is fast approaching and I was wondering if I would need to change accounting packages? I had a brief look at service providers but they all seem prohibitively expensive.
 
The process described by Australian business software industry association, looks rather involved DSPANZ - About STP Products so I suspect the only viable option for businesses with more than 20 employees at 1 April 2018 is to get a third party to do it, buy specific payroll software or change their accounting package. Alternatively a business or software vendor can apply for a delayed implementation (assuming they have a plan to achieve one touch payroll).
 
Thanks for all of the assistance. Can I confirm that Manager is not STP compliant? Would Australian businesses be able to use manager in conjunction with a site such as in order to be compliant? Would Manger be able to create a suitable csv that could be uploaded to the singletouch website from which they will submit it on your behalf? If these is not the case does this render manager useless for Australians? Is there another way of lodging the required single touch payroll information? Thanks for all of the assistance, I understand that I am quite a novice in this particular area
 
Same in NZ ird are making it so small business will have to end up paying for MYOB or xero just to get a payroll for one or two employees. I just built my own payroll with everything in it and it works really well.
 
Single Touch Payroll (STP) is a way of paying your employees. It can be included in your payroll software. It gathers all the relevant information needed to calculate their wages and tax deductions in one process. The data required for this process will be gathered when the employee is hired. Any changes to their pay or deduction rates can be inputted weekly. This is done through an electronic service. An external provider hosts this. STP simplifies the calculation of wages by eliminating one data entry process for employers.
 
The main step to using a single touch payroll system is hiring. All of the data collected at hire will be used for future calculations and payroll reporting requirements. This includes information like full name, contact information and social security number. It may also include things like date of birth and marital status for calculations purposes.

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) receives payroll information from employers through Single Touch Payroll (STP) enabled payroll and accounting software each time the employer runs its payroll. The ATO provides selected employer and job level data items from the STP system to the ABS for the production of official statistics. STP replaces the need for businesses to provide a payment summary annual report or 'group certificates.'
 
STP data is used to produce near real-time weekly indexes of payroll jobs and wages, including weekly changes in the number of payroll jobs, changes in wages and average weekly wages by jobs at the national, state and territory and ANZSIC industry level by selected personal characteristics, including sex and age group.
 
The scope and coverage of these estimates are largely defined and constrained by the characteristics of the data sources from which these estimates are produced. As such, users should note that not all jobs and wages in the Australian labour market are captured within these estimates.
 
Payroll jobs as reported to the ATO through STP are in scope of these estimates. All payroll jobholders regardless of age or Australian residency status are included. Persons reported via STP must hold either a Tax File Number (TFN) or an Australian Business Number (ABN).
 
A payroll job is a relationship between an employee and their employing enterprise, where the employee is paid in the reference week through STP-enabled payroll or accounting software and reported to the ATO. Where an employee is paid other than weekly, the established payment pattern is used to include payroll jobs paid in weeks outside the reference week.
 
Employers with 20 or more employees (large employers) commenced transition to STP reporting on 1 July 2018. Employers with less than 20 employees (small employers) began transitioning to STP on 1 July 2019. Any reporting concessions that were made available for small employers ended on 30 June 2021. At the time of this release, almost all large employers and eligible small employers are reporting through STP.
 
The total wages concept broadly aligns with the Australian System of National Accounts (ASNA) definition of wages and salaries, with the exception of payments to employee's superannuation and severance and termination payments which are excluded.
