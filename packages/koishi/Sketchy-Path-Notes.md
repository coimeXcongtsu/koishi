I take handwritten notes on my iPad in meetings, seminars, etc. I capture and store them in ink and do NOT often convert handwriting to text. All I want to do is to be able to capture both handwritten and typed text inputs into a single note in Evernote. I have tried ALL the big note taking apps (Noteshelf, Notability, Nebo, Apple Notes, etc.). The handwriting experience is superior, but getting things into Evernote is a tedious, multi step process, and it does NOT allow me to combine/mix/alternate between typed and scribed.
 
Here is my use case: I can import a typed agenda into an EN note. I now want to go in and add handwritten notes of various length under each agenda item. So, essentially, create space between typed lines of text, and nest my handwritten notes on that agenda item under the appropriate typed text.

I know that this is precisely what Evernote allows you to do by inserting a sketch, but to be frank, the Evernote handwriting feature is poor. It doesn't feel like a pen or pencil, the resulting handwriting is sketchy and even worse than my own poor penmanship. I need another way to do this and still end up with an Evernote note entry.
 
Once that's done, I may come back to that same note and add additional typed notes, document attachments, etc. So solutions like Penultimate and Noteshelf, which segregate the notes into synced notebooks and don't allow editing in Evernote won't do.
 
So far, the best "integration" I have found is with Apple Notes. It's handwriting capture feels natural and looks great. It lets me insert handwritten space between lines of typed text. (Albeit, often leaving a lot of white space before and after the handwriting, but I can live with that.) I can then send a copy of the Apple Note to Evernote, but Evernote takes all the handwritten sections as separate images and moves them to the bottom of the note, leaving the originally typed text at the top of the note. (My handwritten notes are no longer connected to the written text item they are associated with.)
 
All those lines of typed text (including any blank lines in between) are contained in a single text box. It is a possible, but crude solution to add blank lines of text between lines to create space for ink - but all that does is increase the size of what is still a single text box that a single layer of inked notes are added on top of.
 
The rub with that: Say I insert line breaks to the typed contents and add inked notes after the first agenda item, and then do the same after item 2. If I need to go back to add additional inked notes under item one, I need to add additional line breaks from my keyboard, and now the inked notes that come later are out of place and overlapping other typed text.
 
My question isnt spot on to your issue (which I would also like). But rather, as a very new user to EN -- can you please tell me how I turn off handwriting to text conversion? Its taking my handwritten not and converting them to text automatically.
 
On your iPad, open a note containing typed text. Press and hold your Apple Pencil between the lines of text where you want to insert inked notes. A space is created where you can ink. (You can expand or shrink it with the triangular buttons on the left margin. 


Because you will only use it when you like it, I would try several apps to find out. Personally I use GoodNotes 5, other apps with a good reputation are for example Notability, Noteshelf and Myscript Nebo. Many apps (GN as well) use the Nebo engine to improve their script handling.
 
Penultimate already does offer a **very** rudimentary level of integration within Evernote. But it has such a poor handwriting experience and is so limited and clumsy in its functionality, as compared to **any** of the numerous alternatives that I would **not** view Penultimate as a viable or desirable path towards integrating typed and handwritten notes within Evernote.
 
In the context of wireframing, I don't know that there's a simple way to do this in Inkscape, as Inkscape doesn't have the concept of 'brushes' that something like Adobe Illustrator has (making this rather easy to do).
 
What I have done, however, is made my own 'sketchy' objects just for wireframing. The process was essentially drawing a few UI Primitives (boxes, buttons, etc.) then converting the outlines to shapes, adding extra nodes along each path, then tweaking the position and angle of the nodes to create the 'wiggles'.
 
There are some people who add only a few images to their sketchnotes, and have a lot of text. Other people follow the reverse path. Where ever you fall on the continuum is okay. You can also choose to use more images or text for certain sketchnotes that encourage that style.
 
The easiest icons to draw are those for real objects like cars, coffee cups, and pizza. These make for an easy icon to draw and are easy to identify too. That makes them a great choice to draw in your sketchnotes.
 
The notes you have been given are obviously sketchy. I wonder if asking on SO is really your best learning strategy. There are lots of tutorials on the web, and lots of books which are hopefully in your college library. I think you should be doing a bit more reading and only come here if you are stuck.
 
The :: syntax is for using XPath axes (plural of axis, not axe). child::para says find the child elements of the para element at the current context node. In your document child::para will find nothing as there are no para elements. Nor would school::child::para work as its invalidly laid out and school:: is not a valid XPath axes.
 
Only then it becomes apparent that child is an **axis** (and its name does not depend on the currently processed document) and para is a **node** that is (or is expected to be) found in the processed XML.
 
I connected DT to OC via the DT MIDI OUT the first night and immediately began controlling the OC with simple MIDI commands on Track 9, MIDI channel 1. I tried Track 10 as MIDI channel 2, which also seemed to work, no difference in sounds though. Currently, only pitch bend works to change the nature of the OC sounds.
 
0-coast is awesome little monophonic synthesizer with limited MIDI connectivity. You can send about dozen CC messages and you can send signals to its MIDI-to-CV converter, utilising two gates and two CV channels. This allows to play this synth using MIDI keyboard or external sequencer like Digitakt. Receiving CC is possible mostly only being in Program Pages. Check out the page 14 in the 0-Coast manual -coast\_manual.pdf
You can send MIDI data to 0-Coast using one of Digitakt MIDI channels. Check also MIDI section in Digitakt manual. Digitakt firmware can still be somewhat problematic with MIDI but 0-Coast is hardly pushing its limits, so probably no reason to be worried.
 
Midi B channel is sketchy. It works sometimes. I tried learning midi 2 to midi b. Midi 1 to midi a. That was all sketchy. Usually only Chanel 1 would work. I reset the OC to default settings for that program page (3) to listen on all channels and then any track 9-16 could play notes.
 
MIDI is a wonderful thing and you can do so many things with it in your studio. Most of the parameters of modern synthesisers like Access Virus or Nord Lead you can manipulate with clever messages from the MIDI controller - to change sounds, patches, parameters of synthesis engine, effects chain etc. Digitakt is capable of sequencing most of these tricks (Elektron can not be considered to be the best on General MIDI integration).
 
I can get the O-coast to recognize midi notes and the sequencer fine but can anyone advise me on how to set up the track tempo to sync with the O-coast? I just want to be able to get the arpegiator to play in sync with the Digitakt.
