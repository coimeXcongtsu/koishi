While you are waiting for the VinylMaster people to sort this out through their Support portal over the next few days, let me suggest you download and install a free backup program for cutting right now, and see if you can get things running today.

appears to go both ways - a while back mine came in an email when I got the titan2 but I have read both ways. best to check both to try to find it, otherwise have to wait till they reopen if the machine was purchased from uscutter and shipping payed to guyana - at this point we haven't even heard back which software was selected during purchase so we are all flying blind into the snowstorm.
 
Consult the applicable National Electric Code (NEC) and your local licensing or inspecting authority. In addition, TDLR is available to provide technical assistance. You may reach us via e-mail at electricians@tdlr.texas.gov; **however, if there is a municipal or regional licensing authority, you will be directed to contact them for technical requirements that may be unique to its jurisdiction.**

If no permit is required, the installation would follow the current adopted state code on the day the electrician begins installing the electrical materials or equipment within the residential or commercial building structure. If a permit is/was required, the electrical installation would follow the state adopted code from when the permit was obtained.
 
The local licensing or inspecting authority (i.e. cities, counties, and regions with jurisdiction) is responsible for inspecting work performed in their area(s). TDLR does not perform inspections required for local permitting and code requirements.
 
**3.1. If an unlicensed person performing calibration, testing, inspection, or commissioning of electrical equipment encounters a situation requiring repair or replacement of a component of electrical equipment, may the person do that work?**
 
Electrical work is defined as any labor or material used in installing, maintaining, or extending an electrical wiring system and the appurtenances, apparatus, or equipment used in connection with the use of electrical energy, in, on, outside, or attached to a building, residence, structure, property, or premises. The term includes service entrance conductors as defined by the National Electrical Code.
 
An exemption related to plumbers was approved during the 2007 session of the Texas Legislature under HB 1029 (80R), which amended the Law to allow licensed plumbers to perform the electrical work necessary to install, service, maintain, repair, or replace any type of plumbing fixture or appliance on existing electrical circuits only.
 
TDLR is responsible for the statewide regulation of electricians, but cities have their own authority under state law to establish local ordinances and fee schedules. TDLR encourages interested parties to discuss ordinances and fees with their city officials - as each may address this in a different way.
 
A licensed contractor (i.e. electrical, sign, residential appliance installation) must display its name and license number on both sides of each vehicle owned or operated by the business, and used in the conduct of electrical work. Lettering must be of a contrasting color, and at least two inches in height. The lettering must be permanently affixed in conspicuous places on both sides of the vehicle.
 
A Master Electrician's/Master Sign Electrician's license may be assigned to multiple companies if the Master Electrician/Master Sign Electrician owns more than 50% of the electrical contracting business.
 
If the Master Electrician/Master Sign Electrician does **not** own more than 50% of a company, his license may only be assigned to one electrical contractor, and he must be an employee of that company.
 
Complete an ELC-LIC-004-E Contractor Notice of Change and Duplicate License Request form. All current and new information **must** be completed on the form. Have the new master/master sign electrician complete and sign in the box near the bottom of the form. The company owner of record must sign the bottom line of the form (owner's signature) authorizing the change to the new master/master sign electrician.
 
Yes, if the Master, Journeyman, or Apprentice Electrician also holds a Residential Appliance Installer license. Only the Residential Appliance Installer license will be assigned to the Residential Appliance Installation Contractor license.
 
It depends. Although the state does not require residential appliance installation permits, Section 1305.201(a) of the Texas Electrical Safety and Licensing Act does not prohibit a municipality or region from regulating residential appliance installers. They may, for example, require appliance installers to pull permits, pay fees, or have their work inspected when performing work within their municipality or region.
 
Yes, but ONLY IF the motor originates from a single phase system. IF the electrical originates on a 3 phase system, the answer is NO. For additional related questions you may contact TDLR's Compliance Specialist: Larry Reichle/Electrical Program Specialist (512-779-2857).
 
No. The law added pools that use single phase power of 240 volts or less at business properties and property owned by a municipality. The electrical work for Residential Appliance Installers is still limited to maintenance of electrical pool equipment. For additional related questions you may contact TDLR's Compliance Specialist: Larry Reichle/Electrical Program Specialist (512-779-2857).
 
No. If the electrical originates on a 3 phase system, the work can only be performed through a licensed electrical contractor.? For additional related questions you may contact TDLR's Compliance Specialist: Larry Reichle/Electrical Program Specialist (512-779-2857).
 
A Residential Appliance Installer license is always required when an appliance power cord is being attached in a home or other residential (single or multi-family dwelling less than four stories) installation site. If the appliance power cord is installed at the manufacturing plant or the shop of an authorized manufacturer's representative, then no license is required. Also, there is an exemption for homeowners who reside in the home to do the work **if** the electrical work is not regulated by city ordinance.

Sign-Master, from Decision Resources and later Ashton-Tate, is a companion product to Chart-Master and Diagram-Master. It shares the same ability to produce presentation quality graphics on high resolution printers or plotters, but geared more towards textual presentation slides. This program was also bundled in the Master Graphics Presentation Pack.
 
It features a number of scalable fonts, symbols, text formatting, justification options, color, and tables. It is quite similar to Chart Master and Diagram Master but lacks the specific graphing or charting features.
 
Note: This version is NOT copy protected. This is the first releaseafter Decision Resources was acquired by Ashton-Tate in 1986.Previous versions were copy protected, but Ashton-Tate dropped theprotection.
 
To further assist you, I just made an adjustment on your license, so you can now activate your copy of Nitro Pro by going to Help tab > About Nitro Pro > Activate, entering your serial number and clicking Activate.
 
Please be informed that 'The serial number entered does not exist' means the serial number you are trying to activate is for a different version of Nitro Pro. Looks like we need to uninstall the current version of Nitro Pro on your computer and install Nitro Pro 12. We then activate it using your serial number. Kindly follow these steps:
 
1. Uninstall Nitro Pro from your computer by going to Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features then reboot the machine.
 
2. Please clear all your downloads folder or delete all downloaded Nitro installers. This step is important because we noticed that if you are saving all the installers and you download them in the same folder (like the downloads folder), the EXE can pick up any MSI installer in that folder and you may pick-up one of the older builds instead of the newly downloaded package.
 
An adjustment has been made on your Nitro PDF Pro 12 license. To continue on using your version 12 serial number, please ensure that you install Nitro PDF Pro **12.16.9.574**. The installer can be located from the link below:
