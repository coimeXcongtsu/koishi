On April 8 at the Santa Barbara Bowl, the Princess of Soul took plenty of them, providing the crowd with elements of drama that showcased her musicianship and exhibited her growth from teen songstress to accomplished performer.

Keys started off her 90-minute set with plenty of stage dramatics. Screens were raised to reveal the songstress inside a cage, a songbird eager to break out of her a steel prison as she sang "Caged Bird" from her 2001 debut album "Songs in A Minor."
 
Keys then launched seamlessly into "Love Is Blind" from "The Elements of Freedom" and, in quick succession, sang her 2003 song "You Don't Know" and belted out a nicely arranged performance of her Grammy-award winning song "Fallin' " while playing a small keyboard.
 
Although known more for her musical skills than her dancing showmanship, Keys stepped things up a notch with a sultry performance of "Another Way," her rock 'n' roll song with Jack White from the 2008 James Bond movie "Quantum of Solace." Key's sexy dancers and talented nine-piece band rocked the stage as the singer made her way down the stairs and belted out the tune. Although the funky, rock-infused Bond track stood out amid the mostly R&B show, the song worked nicely nonetheless judging from the Santa Barbara crowd's enthusiastic reaction.
 
"I want you to take a journey with me tonight," Keys told the packed audience early on. "I want you to be Freedom Fighters with me. I want you to be yourselves." Keys spent most of the show reiterating this theme of freedom of self-expression, a theme that runs through "The Elements of Freedom," which was released in November.

Keys shined during energetic performances of her 2003 song "Karma" and "Like the Sea," off the new album, and exhibited why she is a standout among other pop princesses as she skillfully pounded on the keyboard during "I Need You."
 
The show took a more relaxed tone midway as Keys performed a string of her well-known ballads. Taking position behind a grand piano that lit up the stage, Keys beautifully sang "Like You'll Never" and "Diary," which also featured the strong vocals of backup singer Mont Gill.
 
Keys then stretched out on top of the grand piano and sang "Wait Till You See My Smile" from her latest album. She coyly flashed a smile when the word "Change" shined brightly from the huge screen above her.
 
One of the highlights of the show included her jam session with guitarist Willie Brown. The two matched skills note for note as Keys played a huge keyboard shaped like ? what else? ? a key as the audience applauded the musical back-and-forth between the two.
 
While Keys went backstage for a quick change, backup singer Whitney Keaton of Champaign, Ill., wowed the audience with a stunningly soulful solo performance of "Feeling Good" from the 1965 Broadway musical "The Roar of the Greasepaint ? the Smell of the Crowd."
 
Keys reappeared on stage in a stunning white dress and belted out her latest hit "Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart," but garnered the most applause as she worked her fingers behind the grand piano for her Grammy-winning song "If I Ain't Got You."
 
Keys' "Element of Freedom" tour ? complete with an elaborate set, plenty of wardrobe changes and dancing on stage ? is a departure from her more straightforward performance during the 2008 "As I Am" world tour. Now 29, the New York City native seems more comfortable commanding the stage and displaying her sultry side. She ended her set with a rousing performance of her version of "Empire State of Mind," one of her more successful collaborations to date with rapper Jay-Z.
 
Before Keys took the stage, Canadian R&B singer Melanie Fiona gave a short but sweet 30-minute performance that featured songs from her Grammy-nominated 2009 album "The Bridge." Fiona showcased her vocal reach with her epic single "It Kills Me" and the catchy "Give It to Me Right," which heavily samples the 1968 hit "Time of the Season" by The Zombies.
