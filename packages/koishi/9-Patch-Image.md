IMAGE is a Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) complimentary program that serves the business community by strengthening their hiring practices through training and education. It is a voluntary partnership initiative between the federal government and private sector employers. Businesses who enroll in IMAGE are provided with several trainings and guidance in topics such as anti-discrimination, fraudulent documents, E-Verify, forced labor, and overview on child labor. All businesses seeking to become IMAGE members are subject to a Form I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification Form) audit without facing penalties or fines for errors found on the Form I-9 as part of the inspection conducted. Employees with document discrepancies are given the opportunity to provide valid documentation that allow them to work legally in the U.S. Identifying unauthorized employees does not disqualify a business from becoming a member. Knowingly hiring an illegal workforce DOES disqualify a business from becoming a member. Knowingly hiring undocumented noncitizens is a crime and will be penalized.
 
IMAGE is a voluntary partnership initiative between the federal government and private sector employers. The initiative is designed to foster cooperative relationships and to strengthen overall hiring practices.
 
HSI developed this initiative for employer self-compliance within the worksite enforcement program, through which employers can achieve a lawful workforce through self-policing of their hiring practices.
 
Many people are drawn to the United States in search of jobs. U.S. companies face fines and owners face possible imprisonment if they violate laws related to employment and employment eligibility. IMAGE was developed as an avenue through which HSI can assist employers seeking to improve hiring practices.

HSI recognizes that the highest level of employment integrity can only be achieved through close coordination with industry partners. Furthermore, industry self-policing will allow HSI to focus on other aspects of its homeland security mission.
 
No. However, participants in the IMAGE program are required to use E-Verify, a free online employment eligibility verification system operated jointly by the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration.
 
In addition, IMAGE membership can enhance your corporate image by associating your company with sound hiring practices and helps to secure the homeland by reducing opportunities to inadvertently hire unauthorized workers.
 
HSI will waive any applicable fines if any technical or substantive violations are discovered on the Forms I-9 reviewed as part of the inspection conducted, as long as there is no evidence of a criminal violation.
 
If the employee presented the employer with documents that reasonably appeared to be genuine and relate to the employee presenting them, you cannot be charged with a verification violation. This type of circumstance underscores the importance of why HSI is advocating participation in the IMAGE program and E-Verify for all employers.
 
It should contain text that could replace the image without changing the meaning of the page. It is not meant to supplement the image and should not repeat information that is already provided in the captions above or below the image.
 
The component accepts a number of additional properties beyond those which are required. This section describes the most commonly-used properties of the Image component. Find details about more rarely-used properties in the Advanced Props section.
 
If no styles are applied to the image, the image will stretch to fit the container. You may prefer to set object-fit: "contain" for an image which is letterboxed to fit the container and preserve aspect ratio.
 
Alternatively, object-fit: "cover" will cause the image to fill the entire container and be cropped to preserve aspect ratio. For this to look correct, the overflow: "hidden" style should be assigned to the parent element.
 
A string, similar to a media query, that provides information about how wide the image will be at different breakpoints. The value of sizes will greatly affect performance for images using fill or which are styled to have a responsive size.
 
For example, if you know your styling will cause an image to be full-width on mobile devices, in a 2-column layout on tablets, and a 3-column layout on desktop displays, you should include a sizes property such as the following:
 
This example sizes could have a dramatic effect on performance metrics. Without the 33vw sizes, the image selected from the server would be 3 times as wide as it needs to be. Because file size is proportional to the square of the width, without sizes the user would download an image that's 9 times larger than necessary.
 
You should use the priority property on any image detected as the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element. It may be appropriate to have multiple priority images, as different images may be the LCP element for different viewport sizes.
 
When blur, the blurDataURL property will be used as the placeholder. If src is an object from a static import and the imported image is .jpg, .png, .webp, or .avif, then blurDataURL will be automatically populated, except when the image is detected to be animated.
 
Remember that the required width and height props can interact with your styling. If you use styling to modify an image's width, you should also style its height to auto to preserve its intrinsic aspect ratio, or your image will be distorted.
 
**Recommendation**: This property is only meant for advanced use cases. Switching an image to load with eager will normally **hurt performance**. We recommend using the priority property instead, which will eagerly preload the image.
 
To protect your application from malicious users, configuration is required in order to use external images. This ensures that only external images from your account can be served from the Next.js Image Optimization API. These external images can be configured with the remotePatterns property in your next.config.js file, as shown below:
 
**Good to know**: The example above will ensure the src property of next/image must start with or or any number of subdomains. Any other protocol, port, or unmatched hostname will respond with 400 Bad Request.
 
**Good to know**: When omitting protocol, port or pathname, then the wildcard \*\* is implied. This is not recommended because it may allow malicious actors to optimize urls you did not intend.
 
**Warning**: Deprecated since Next.js 14 in favor of strict remotePatterns in order to protect your application from malicious users. Only use domains if you own all the content served from the domain.
 
The following configuration is for advanced use cases and is usually not necessary. If you choose to configure the properties below, you will override any changes to the Next.js defaults in future updates.
 
If you know the expected device widths of your users, you can specify a list of device width breakpoints using the deviceSizes property in next.config.js. These widths are used when the next/image component uses sizes prop to ensure the correct image is served for user's device.
 
You can specify a list of image widths using the images.imageSizes property in your next.config.js file. These widths are concatenated with the array of device sizes to form the full array of sizes used to generate image srcsets.
 
The reason there are two separate lists is that imageSizes is only used for images which provide a sizes prop, which indicates that the image is less than the full width of the screen. **Therefore, the sizes in imageSizes should all be smaller than the smallest size in deviceSizes.**
 
If the Accept head matches more than one of the configured formats, the first match in the array is used. Therefore, the array order matters. If there is no match (or the source image is animated), the Image Optimization API will fallback to the original image's format.
 
Images are optimized dynamically upon request and stored in the /cache/images directory. The optimized image file will be served for subsequent requests until the expiration is reached. When a request is made that matches a cached but expired file, the expired image is served stale immediately. Then the image is optimized again in the background (also called revalidation) and saved to the cache with the new expiration date.
 
The expiration (or rather Max Age) is defined by either the minimumCacheTTL configuration or the upstream image Cache-Control header, whichever is larger. Specifically, the max-age value of the Cache-Control header is used. If both s-maxage and max-age are found, then s-maxage is preferred. The max-age is also passed-through to any downstream clients including CDNs and browsers.
 
You can configure the Time to Live (TTL) in seconds for cached optimized images. In many cases, it's better to use a Static Image Import which will automatically hash the file contents and cache the image forever with a Cache-Control header of immutable.
 
The default loader does not optimize SVG images for a few reasons. First, SVG is a vector format meaning it can be resized losslessly. Second, SVG has many of the same features as HTML/CSS, which can lead to vulnerabilities without proper Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
 
In addition, it is strongly recommended to also set contentDispositionType to force the browser to download the image, as well as contentSecurityPolicy to prevent scripts embedded in the image from execu
