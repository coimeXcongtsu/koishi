I noticed foremost that the gumball machines were located very close to the entrance, in plain view of anyone who sauntered in. They were arranged in a pleasing two-level cluster up to my knees. I circled the cluster to find a machine that dispensed a desirable gumball-type, then crouched down with a quarter. It was clear that all the gumballs offered were 25-cents a piece. I placed the quarter into the quarter-shaped slot intuitively, then turned the bottom dial, which cranked the quarter into the machine. I could hear the mechanism within turn and then click, and then the sound of something solid drop onto metal. I then opened the bottom flap to then have my 25 cents slide out onto the floor. Next to me a horde of kids had gathered, eying the machines and fingering quarters greedily. I noticed that all of them cupped their hands below the dispenser before they opened the flap; the machine is fairly simple to use, making it ideal for children. Because children doubtlessly use many similar quarter-accepting round-object-dispensing machines they learn quickly to compensate for the flat, poorly-designed dispenser.
 
A few of the products the machine offers would be a necessity for those in its target demographic (women using the restroom). The products available for purchase are not displayed prominently, allowing the more discreet purchase of private hygiene products. Instructions are also given on how to operate the machine.

The amount of steps that must be taken are more complex and elaborate than those taken by a gumball machine. Non-native speakers or those with reading/ visual problems such as dyslexia may have problems operating the machine. The machine is also difficult for children and those with restricted dexterity, such as arthritic patients, to operate.
 
I noticed that the coke machine was next to another diet coke machine. I noted that the choice for diet or regular via vending machine was nice. I then walked over to the regular machine and first noticed the large glass display to the left. I scanned the various drinks, feeling in control of what product I chose, and picked a drink, noting its price and id. To the right. the first thing to catch my eye is a large green bottle-shaped dispenser, which I know intuitively is where my drink will appear after purchase. I put in the dollar bills, hoping I put it in the right way, and then input the id without much thought. The sound of a machine starting up alert me to the left display, where my drink is dropped onto a conveyor belt that then moves up to move the drink to the green bottle-shaped dispenser. The drink clanks into the drink-like dispenser. The clatter of coins alerts me to my change, which is in the lit dispenser near the bottom right of the machine. Although there were a greater number of steps, the process was very smooth and little thought went into operating the machine, aside from choosing the drink.
