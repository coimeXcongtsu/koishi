**Be sure to alert us if the name on your application is different from the name on your score report.** You do not need to notify us about minor differences in spacing or hyphenation (such as "Juan Carlos" vs. "JuanCarlos" or "Jane Henry Doe" vs. "Jane Henry-Doe").

Ask Educational Testing Service to report scores to the Duke University Graduate School. **Use institution code 5156**. ETS will require you to select a department code. It does not matter which department code you choose. The Graduate School will receive the scores as long as you choose institution code 5156.
 
The IELTS Academic test is administered by Cambridge ESOL, British Council, and IDP: IELTS Australia. See www.ielts.org for more information. The Duke University Graduate School is registered to receive electronic IELTS scores using the IELTS Results Service E-Delivery. Please send scores via e-delivery by selecting the "Duke University Graduate School" option.
 
If you do not see an option for electronic scores when using "Duke University Graduate School " as the Institution on the request form, try using "Duke University" as the Institution and "Graduate School" for the Department. The process for selecting e-delivery recipients may be slightly different depending on the organization administering the IELTS test. Please refer to the IELTS website for information regarding testing policies.
 
All admitted international students whose first language is not English are required to take placement exams conducted by the English for International Students program at the beginning of the term of matriculation, even if the TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo English Test requirement is waived (see below). Depending on the exam results, students are either exempted from or placed into EIS courses.

To be eligible for a TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo English Test waiver, you must have studied fulltime for two years or more at a college or university where the sole language of instruction is English and in a country where English is the primary spoken language. The two years of study must be completed **prior to the start of the program**.
 
If you believe you qualify for a TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo English Test waiver based on the above criteria, indicate your eligibility in the Additional Academic Information section of the application under the Test Score Instructions for the TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo English Test exam. **Due to the volume of applications we receive, we will not examine, confirm the status of, or grant any waiver requests prior to extending an offer of admission.**
