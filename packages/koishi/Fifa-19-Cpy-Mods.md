
 
Good morning. If I have not read wrong (English is not my language) I must post in this section. If not, I apologize.  
I open the discussion to see if it is possible to have a mod for fifa 20 that goes to correct Juventus after problems with the license.  
Is it possible to do something or can't you do anything about it?

Welcome to FIFA Modding World! Here you can find multiple mods for FIFA 22 & 23 and chat with modders and players. We even have multiple channels dedicated to other topics for example anime & manga, motorsports, movies, music and more! We also do giveaways for members just to give back to all the members joining and communicating with others. Suggestions to the server are always welcome as well!
 
FIFA 20 mods are exclusive to PC, and open up myriad options for refreshing your game. While using them online will get you banned from FIFA 20, there's plenty of scope for deploying these tweaks offline to modify career mode and the preset player database. Obviously, back up your saves as often as possible if you're going to start tinkering. Below is all you need to know about utilising FIFA 20 mods on PC.
 
There are mods in the more traditional sense, too: you download a file, and then put it in the relevant place in your FIFA 20 files, usually in the FIFA 20 > Data folder. Again, each modder will have their own set of instructions.
 
In terms of finding new mods, a number of experienced modders have told us that this soccergaming.com forum is a good place to find new downloads. This Discord server, ran by modder Aranaktu and frequented by FIFER is another good source of discussion and help.
 
Known as the Career Mode Cheat Table for previous FIFA versions, this is a tool from modder Aranaktu that lets you edit players, managers, budgets, career mode scouting, and lots more. It's comprehensive: you can edit player data, change player training to give them unlimited sessions, hire free scouts, disable morale, reveal the potentials of every scouted player, give yourself unlimited subs, and much much more.
 
Thanks to modders FIFER, Aranaktu and paulv2k4 for their help with this piece. FIFA 20 is out now. Want to base your career mode team on which has the best strip? Then you need our guide to FIFA 20 kits.
