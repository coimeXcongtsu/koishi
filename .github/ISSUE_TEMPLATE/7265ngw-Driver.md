I'm upgrading my son's laptop for college. Already installed 16GB of RAM and replaced the HD with a Samsung SSD. Last piece of the puzzle was upgrading the wifi. I know its a single antenna so I'll need an additional one, however after installing the 7265NGW WiFi (which is in the list in the service manual) card it shows in device manager but its got a CODE 10 unable to start error. I installed all the drivers but still doesn't seem to be working. Put the old card in and WiFi works fine. Anyone had any experience with updating a WiFi card into one of these laptops?
 
No, but I didn't think HP was actually doing a firmware update. It does show up in device manager it just won't load. Adding an antenna isn't a big deal to me. I'll track down the single and give it a shot. Just irritates me that HP restricts items this much. Its why typically stay in Lenovo, but this is a decent machine and should do fine as a start to college.

Well, something isn't right because even with one antenna cable attached to the Main or #1 terminal, the card should have worked right from the get-go, which tells me that you're probably right about the PC not liking the flavor of that particular card for some reason.
 
I am running Ubuntu Linux on an Acer V Nitro - VN7-571G laptop which uses an Itel AC 7265NGW wireless module. Quite often the system loses WiFi connectivity with the router, I guess this is a driver issue since the other Windows laptop works fine, and also the other devices: Chrome Cast, Android phones and tablet. Where can I find a proper driver?
 
The drivers for Linux for this adapter are not yet available in our download center, however, please access this link for assistance regarding the drivers for Linux\*. Once you there, access the link that says Community Page.
 
Linux is different to Windows regarding the wireless drivers which are delivered along with the kernel. Intel only supports the kernel team developing these drivers, which will be shiped with the kernel. So some one must check what is the right version of the kernel for his/her PC. Here is the official list from kernel.org: This adapter is supported starting with kernel version 3.13. I shall check on my laptop what kernel do I have and address the issue on the communitiy mailing list.
 
aleki\_intel for the moment I "solved" the issue through an work-around: I had disabled 802.11N and now the connection is stable. Of course, I am not using anymore the full capacity of the 7265 controller, but it seems that there more problems in the Intel iwlwifi driver. Until a real fix will be available in the kernel/firmware will be available, I can live with that. But it seems that I am not the only one have this issue, because I found it described on this blog post: -wifi-connection-on-ubuntu-14-04-trusty-tahr-ctrl-event-disconnected-reason4-locally\_generated1/ Unstable wifi connection on Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr (CTRL-EVENT-DISCONNECTED reason=4 locally\_generated=1) | zeroset
 
Hmm, I wouldn't say that the issue had been resolved. This is more like an work-around which is acceptable for time-being. The real solution shall be in the kernel and firmware, but of course this is not in Intel hands. As a general advice in the future when buying PC for Linux usage, it should be verified if it is completely supported by the vendor for Linux.

I'm new to SK-TDA4VM and I have a question regarding the compatibility of the "Intel Model 7265NGW AN" WiFi card with the v8.6.0 Linux SDK.
After installing the WiFi card, I couldn't find any interface listed in 'ifconfig.' Are there additional configurations needed to enable it?
I would greatly appreciate your guidance on how to bring up this WiFi card on my SK-TDA4VM board.
 
Otherwise, it looks like a different model of WiFi card is used in our particular case, so you may encounter some difficulties if choosing not to go with the model 9260 and attempting to enable the 7265 WiFi card. If you are fine with it taking time and effort, I can give some suggestions on how one may be able to enable new Intel modules.
 
Thank you for your prompt response and the recommendation to use the 9260 WiFi card. However, due to certain dependencies, I must interface with the 7265 card at this time. I understand that this might not be a standard configuration, but I'm willing to invest the time and effort to enable it.
 
If you could provide any guidance or suggestions on how to enable the 7265 WiFi card with the v8.6.0 Linux SDK on the SK-TDA4VM board, I would greatly appreciate it. Any assistance you can offer in this regard would be immensely helpful in my current project.
 
I followed your advice and placed the prebuilt driver for the 7265 Wi-Fi card in the '/lib/firmware' folder. 
This simple step resulted in the appearance of a new interface when I checked 'ifconfig'
 
Afterward, I configured the board as a WiFi Station, and I'm thrilled to report that I now have a working Wi-Fi connection on my SK-TDA4VM board.
Microcode firmware for all Intel Wireless Adaptors are available here: Linux\* Support for Intel Wireless Adapters 
(If the microcode is not available for an Intel adapter, you can transfer the contents from the standard Ubuntu's /lib/firmware/\* directory to the lib/firmware/\* directory on the SK-TDA4VM board.)
 
I tethered the laptop with my mobile phone so it could connect to the network like that, which worked fine, but it will not download any new drivers for the network adapter. I've removed all of the network devices from the device manager and rebooted, this did not help. I've done system restore twice. It will not let me roll back to Home but it's reinstalled Pro twice.
 
does not match, channel 5 is a 2.4 GHz channel while you tell the driver to use the 5 GHz band (option hwmode '11g' would be needed here). No Intel driver at all supports AP mode in the 5 GHz band, so you're restricted to using the 2.4 GHz band (but again, Intel wireless hardware isn't made for running in AP mode - and that might show).
 
I had the same problem after updating from Ubuntu 19.04 to 19.10. It seems that before the update process, we both probably had the package "backport-iwlwifi-dkms" installed, either manually or automatically. That package compiled a driver for the specific version kernel you were on. Although it may have mostly worked after the update, the Additional Drivers tool identified a compatibility mismatch with the new kernel.
 
The problem is also present for new installs of Ubuntu MATE and has nothing to do with the upgrade - I tried with the Ubuntu Mate 18.10 and Kubuntu 19.10 on a USB stick: same behavior. So I would say all Ubuntu 19.10 flavors are affected.
 
The router is new, fresh out of the box. Updated the firmware to the latest version. The adapter driver also updated to the latest version.
 The router and the laptop only a meter apart, no barrier whatsoever.
 
Unfortunately, my problem isn't the internet speed. I only have a 50Mbps connection anyway so there's no problem reaching max internet speed available to me on all of my devices. (constant 50 Mbps down and 25Mbps up)
 
The issue was the local network connection itself, because I plan to transfer files between devices within the network (PC/NAS/laptop/phone). The NAS are connected through the gigabit switch, so no problem there.
 

 At the moment I have to use a gigabit ethernet adapter to get better speed for my laptop, but then what's the point of having high speed AC wifi ^^; I was hoping to be able to utilize the router to it's maximum potential.
 
Hello, if the 5GHz wireless link speed got stuck at 173.3Mbps, we have little to do with the slow the transfer speed. Is it possible to get another laptop with 5GHz wireless card to do a simple comparison? Or you can connect this laptop to another 5GHz network and see if it can negotiate with a higher speed.
 
I am having the same issue. I spent a few hours yesterday trying to figure this out but I am still pretty new to Linux so have not had any luck yet. If I figure things out or find a more detailed guide I will share.
 
Has anyone been able to get this to work with kali? I moved the new driver over to /lib/firmware and disabled the default all fine. I am able to see networks only after turning wifi off and back on in the setting and cannot connect to any. Any thougths?
 
i have Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX200 , how do i know the version of my driver , can u write that command line in the 5 step for me ( im Linux beginner and my english is not good sorry ) , have been stuck with no wifi adapter found for 3 days
 
Thanks! With the dnf provides command I could figure out which package provides the actual blob needed. No Idea why, but non of the iwl\* packages were installed. What I did now: # installed the package that provides the blob I copied manually ...
 
@NoneenoN Glad to see these firmware drivers have finally been added to the dnf package source. When I wrote my original post, this was not yet the case. The steps you provided should be the preferred way to install these drivers on Fedora (and RHEL/CentOS/Rocky) moving forward.
