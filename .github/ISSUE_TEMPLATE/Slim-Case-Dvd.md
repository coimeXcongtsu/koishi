Slimline jewel cases first gained popularity as cases for CD singles sold in Japan and Europe, and have become a common space-saving packaging for burned CDs. The cases used for CD singles sold in Japan and Europe are 7 mm thick, with a "J-card" type inlay, showing cover art through the front of the case, and also through both the spine and part of the back of the case. The CD itself is usually inserted "upside-down" in the case, so that the artwork on the disc itself shows through the transparen...
 
I have added plenty of CD singles, and related artwork. I agree with @jesus2099. This is just another example of MB messing with language a bit. What they mean is what we expect - thin MUSIC CD single cases. The thin things like in the example photo. I expect this is why they show the different types behind the link.
 
Edit: I just seen you also said that in that ticket. I would not be using sizes in mm as most people are not picking up rulers to check. Surely this is now the standard double case? Or hinged double CD jewel case?
 
There are always exceptions to everything. I have albums and EPs in these slim cases too. For example, a boxset reissue of multiple albums using slim cases. I also have singles in standard jewel cases.

I have now bought five of these sensational little cases. After six months of relatively hard wear, they still look new and smart. They are easy to get on and off and keep the AirTag securely fitted at all times. These are a great design and, considering how well they perform, excellent value.

The Pocket 2 slim case has been re-engineered from its Pocket 1 counterpart. The Pocket 2 Slim Case provides the best security and protection for your camera, whilst maintaining a slim profile for easy storage.
 
When you're finished filming the rubber-lined cap gently holds your Pocket 2 even with a filter or wide-angle lens on - all locked down! It may be slim but the Pocket 2 Slim Case is still able to take use and abuse. During testing one was accidentally sat on and it handled it fine.
 
These cases are great on their own but make one heck of a filming rig when used with the Micro Pro 2 - 4th axis stabiliser and a counterweight set. The Micro Pro 2 uses the popular -20 attachment so it can be used with other cameras such as GoPros, Osmo Action, Insta360 and Vuse too. 

There are 3 sound pipes on the front and both sides so that all mics can still record audio in the case.

The patented, 360 rotating tray design makes for a smooth and easy shift from portrait to landscape mode. Plus, you can unfold the cover to serve as a stand, so your video conferences and FaceTime calls are in the most comfortable viewing position.

which case do you use for your Pixel 7? I currently have the "Spigen Thin Fit" case ( -7-case-thin-fit) but the bezel around the screen is very "high" (1mm) above the screen which makes the gestures hard to use (while it protects the screen better of course).
 
Does someone know a case where the bezel height is lower? For my old phone I had one where this was barely noticable. Unfortunately this is a property which is hard to guess from the product description.
 
Correct. Though the distance between a properly sized protector and the case edge is such that you will not notice a tactile depresssion in use. As for the distance of the Moment M-Force case edge above a generic glass screen protector on a P7 as measured with with a digital depth micrometer along multiple points: around 0.65mm to 0.70mm
 
I picked up a few of these faux leather cases too and have been really happy with them. They are a bit bulkier of course, but they feel great. Having the button area exposed makes for much easier right-edge swipes too.
 
I've got 3 cases for the Pixel 7 (perhaps a bit excessive I know). I scored the Mous and RhinoShield on Black Friday sales at significant discounts or otherwise wouldn't have bought them. Note that I have not dropped the P7 so cannot vouch for 6 ft/10 ft drop protection claims and don't intend to test. None
