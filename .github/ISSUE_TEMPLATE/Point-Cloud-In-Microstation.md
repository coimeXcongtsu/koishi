CPU
Faster processor will speed up tool processing time. TopoDOT for MicroStation Connect will utilize multiple cores; therefore, the number of cores, faster clock speeds, and current architecture will all directly affect TopoDOT performance. Processor recommendation would be a current-generation Intel i7 or i9.
 
RAM
When loading data into TopoDOT to display / process, the data is loaded into RAM. MicroStation Connect is 64-bit, so the amount of point cloud data that can be loaded will depend on the amount of RAM available on the system\*. Faster memory clock speeds will provide TopoDOT tools faster access to the point cloud data; thus improving performance\*\*. 16GB will allow for roughly 500 million points, 32GB would allow roughly 1 billion points.

TopoDOT does not utilize any sort of GPU processing for any if its tools. Thus, shoot for maximum compatibility with Bentley MicroStation or maximum performance for additional processing suites in your workflow.

MicroStation users can work efficiently with large point clouds directly using MicroStation tools and commands! The CloudWorx application adds simple tools for viewing and working with slices of point cloud data to speed up 2D drawing creation. Powerful new modeling tools enable as-built piping models and other 3D constructions to be created from point cloud data in the MicroStation environment.
 
I am wondering if there are other software which you can use to digitize point clouds. Many of them can do automatic classification, but that is not what I want. The determining factor is **not** "free software" here.
 
I've installed the free Trial of ArcGIS Pro and tested the 3D Editor on my LAS dataset. I was able to draw features within the point cloud. Nonetheless, the usability and performance was pretty bad for a data set with 50,000,000 points. Seems like ArcGIS is not the best tool to draw 3D objects with geographic information.
 
The LiDAR Module offers a 3D feature extraction or digitizing tool. Utilizing the perpendicular profiling function, a series of points can be placed in successive profile views resulting in the creation of 3D areas or line features. This provides a way to digitize highly accurate 3D features from LiDAR or terrain data, such as road edge and curb lines, powerlines, and buildings.

An integrated approach to both 2D and 3D design allows you to develop better designs, faster, and better inform stakeholders with clearer communication of design intent. Our guest for this presentation, Kirster Surell, an independent CAD/BIM/GIS consultant will show us just what that means. In this live session, watch as she takes flat 2D Shape files and converts them into a 3D model that could be used for presentation and planning purposes.
 
Explore the cutting edge of 3D CAD technology.

You will learn how to redefine your design and engineering potential.
 
A digital twin is only as good as the data that comprises it. To combat risk, industrial leaders enlist 3D data capture technology to maintain an accurate as-is condition of the asset as continuous change occurs throughout the asset and operations lifecycle.
 
Available on our secure cloud platform Connect, AVEVA Point Cloud Manager manages massive amounts of 3D point cloud data by creating an accessible, detailed, and secure digital twin to enable data-rich value additions to brownfield, greenfield and maintenance projects. Ensure the digital and physical representations are aligned to help you make informed decisions, reduce project rework, and improve safety on your most critical assets.

A provider of 3D laser scanning and engineering services, BLOM needed a reliable way to translate the scan data from an asset into an accurate and trustworthy digital asset. By choosing AVEVA, BLOM was able to optimize its scanning process and cut installation times by 25% and bills of material by 35%.
 
Atkins, a global leader in design, engineering, and project management consulting, increased its design efficiency by 40% after implementing AVEVA E3D. With 3D laser scanning capabilities and cloud integration, the company was able to reduce risk, improve design quality, and save costs on brownfield project execution.
 
As the AEC industry moves to modelling, analysis and new design processes, 3D data is becoming much more commonplace. But it is not all about Building Information Modelling (BIM). Laser scanners and the 3D point clouds they generate have also become an industry hot topic.
 
While laser scanners are still expensive, many surveyors use them regularly for civil engineering, process plant and architecture projects. CAD software vendors, including Bentley and Autodesk, have added support for point clouds within their core design packages. AEC professionals can import and work with the 3D data.
 
For many years Pointools was one of the leading developers of point cloud display and editing. Its products made light work of manipulating huge point clouds and offered editing tools to manipulate and make sense of all those 3D dots.
 
The driving force behind Pointools was Faraz Ravi, a former architect, who got into programming and developed the product alongside a surveying company in North London. In 2011, Bentley Systems acquired Pointools and made Mr Ravi its director of product management for point clouds.
 
Bentley sees point clouds as a fundamental data type and wants its users to use point clouds just like any other data type. Just as Descartes first enabled raster data to be used and processed within any MicroStation-based product, the recently launched V8i (SELECTseries 3) release of Descartes now offers similar functionality for point cloud data.
 
In parallel to these new developments in Descartes Bentley was also on the look out for technology to enhance its in-house capabilities. This happened in November 2011 with its acquisition of Pointools.
 
**Pointools** is a standalone application for clean up and processing of point clouds. It is used when workflows are more point cloud-centric or when data needs to be prepared for downstream use.
 
Bentley has been working with the Pointools development team on a ProjectWise module called ProjectWise point cloud streaming service, which allows firms to manage, segment and stream point clouds into a client session. This could be MicroStation, Bentley Navigator or the Bentley Navigator V8i for iPad app. Suddenly point clouds can be everywhere.
 
Just like a DGN or a 2D raster image, Bentley considers a point cloud to be a class one model, a fundamental data type. With this in mind it encourages the direct use of point clouds in engineering workflows in building, plant and civils applications. Just like a 2D raster file they can add context, be used as a backdrop for digitising and can also be edited.
 
This approach is different to the one taken by a lot of hardware and software vendors, which regard point clouds as a survey format and think they need to be turned into something else before they are useful. This could be 3D CAD data or, the current industry favourite, fully loaded BIM models.
 
To help support its so-called fundamental data type, Bentley is keen to point out that all of its point cloud capable products share a common data format, POD, which is the native format of Pointools. This means Bentley users do not have to convert into different representations, which can be a very lengthy process.
 
While Bentley acquired Pointools in November 2011, it is still in the process of integrating Pointools Edit into its portfolio. This will happen later this year with the release of Bentley Pointools, an enhanced version of the software.
 
Point cloud data can be imported from a number of different formats, including proprietary formats from laser scanner manufacturers, Riegl, Faro, Leica and others. Once inside, data can be pre-processed, to reduce noise or change the colour of points. As the laser scan data is accurate, it is possible to take exact measurements. There are also some smart tools for point selection.
 
In terms of CAD data, Pointools can work with 2D and 3D data, but support is fairly limited, including 3ds and 2D DWG. CAD data import is sufficient for visualisation purposes, but if you want to start looking at engineering data, you really need an engineering package like MicroStation or Descartes. Interestingly, there is no support for DGN yet, but this should change soon.
 
Layers can also be used to help clean up noise and obstructions. For example, temporarily remove the exterior of a building in order to get access to the interior. Layers are also useful for exporting chunks of data out in multi user workflows.
 
Another new feature for Bentley Pointools will be the ability to transform objects and manipula
