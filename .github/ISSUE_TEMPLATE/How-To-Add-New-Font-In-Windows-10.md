Windows fonts are one aspect of this convergence: Windows 10 introduces a recommended UWP font set that is common across all editions that support UWP, including Desktop, Server, and Xbox.

A number of additional fonts are available for Desktop and Server, including all other fonts from previous releases. However, not all of these are pre-installed by default in all images. In order to make disk usage and font choices more relevant to users according to the languages that they use, a number of fonts have been moved into optional, on-demand packages. These packages are designed around the different scripts that fonts are primarily intended to support, and most are added automatically by Windows Update when the associated languages are enabled in language settings (for example, by enabling a keyboard). Any of these Feature On Demand (FOD) packages can also be added manually via Settings. To add font packages manually, select the Start button, and then select Settings > System > Optional features (if on a version older than Windows 10 22H2, navigate to Settings > Apps > Apps & features > Optional features instead).
 
One way you can change the style of a document is by adding a new text font. To add a font to Word, download and install the font in Windows, where it will become available to all Microsoft 365 applications.
 
All fonts are stored in the C:\Windows\Fonts folder. Optionally, you can add fonts by simply dragging font files from the extracted files folder into this folder. Windows will then automatically install them. To see what a font looks like, open the Fonts folder, right-click the font file, then select Preview.
 
I'm doing all graphic design in a startup company of some friends, and a major part of our product is developing an app that should run on everything after iPhone 4. So after some researching (I have basically zero UI design experience) I figured we should use the San Francisco font for the app.
 
I managed to get the font from other sources, installed it, but it doesn't appear in either PS or AI. I also installed it on a different PC with a different Adobe CS version but that didn't work either.

Here are all the fonts you need. BUT, for some reason, at least in my case, if I install the italics I can not choose the regular font in an application.I don't know why and haven't tried anything like renaming or such because I just found all of this.Which is thy I have not installed the italics at the moment. But the rest works just fine.
 
Unfortunately Apple aren't too concerned with Windows users. They expect everyone who is designing for Mac to use a Mac. And since the San Francisco font has been created with specific features only available for Mac it is only available on Mac and unlikely to be available on Windows any time soon (unless someone decides to hack it, which is a possibility).
 
As you can see, San Francisco is very similar to Helvetica in shape, but possibly closer to Roboto in proportions and FF DIN in weight... Wether any of that matters much to you is obviously up to you. Personally I'd just stick with Helvetica.
 
Is there a Windows compatible font that is very close to or identical to Creo's ISOFONT? I want to make notations in an image editor that are in the same font. It's a simple enough font, but I can't find anything that looks right.
 
It's interesting how much of a difference there is between fonts that look, at first glance, very similar. The sheer variety in terms of how each handles the shape of an "8", for example. Nevermind what I usually care about, the "I", "l", "1" uniqueness requirement, "0" (zero) with an identifying feature to differentiate it from the letter "O", etc. The Gill Sans font fails miserably in this respect, typing "Il1" in it looks like a Roman numeral 3.
 
The Creo fonts that aren't true type are in ".fnt" files, but they don't appear to be Windows ".fnt" files - my operating system doesn't recognize them. They must be a more ancient type of font file, probably from the Unix days?
 
Suppose I have two forms in a Windows Forms Application: the main window and a child window that will displayed as a dialog of the first. The main window contains a set of controls including a menu strip and toolbar.
 
How can I ensure that all controls in both forms will use the same, user-configurable font? Testing this really quickly using the VS designer, I set the Font property of the main form to something other than the default and ensure that all of the controls in that form are set with the default. Doing so results in some controls adjusting accordingly, but the font of the menu strip and toolbar remain the same/default. Is this by design with those controls or is there something obvious that I'm missing?
 
As for the second form, I am displaying this form a child dialog of the main form. Unless I explicitly set the font of the child form it fails to display using the same font as the main form (despite being configured with the default font). Is setting the font of dialog windows to match the parent the correct approach or am I missing something?
 
It is not quite inheritance, the feature is called 'ambient property'. When the Font property hasn't been assigned, either in the designer (shown in **bold**) or in your code then the control uses the Font property of its Parent. Which is very convenient, it allows for a very consistent look-and-feel and helps getting layout consistent on machines that run with a different video dots-per-inch setting. Other ambient properties are BackColor, ForeColor, Cursor, RightToLeft. There's plumbing to make sure this still works if the Parent changed or the parent changes its property value.
 
What follows is that the buck stops when there is no Parent anymore. Which happens for Form, it doesn't have a Parent. So it is up to you to assign the Form's Font property if you want to use a value that's different from the one you picked in the designer. Easy to do:
 
The ToolStrip and MenuStrip classes behave a bit differently. Unless expressly assigned, they initialize their Font from a system setting. The user can pick the font face and point size that she prefers in the Display applet in Control Panel (Personalization in Windows 7). Overriding this selection is certainly possible, but you generally should not do this and honor the user's preference. The control panel dialog looks like this:
 
But, you can also have a Static Class that will contain the font and all of your form can just Get the good font from it and apply it to itself. This could be set in the main form and read from all other forms.
 
Is there a way to increase the font size on a Windows Help file (CHM file) with recent versions of Internet Explorer? You used to be able to, but I think after IE7 the option was removed from the UI.
 
There is a little problem though. The program is shareware but you can't really pay for it since the company seems to have vanished from the face of the earth and all links are dead. However, it does the job and I'm quite happy with it.
 
The problem with Kchmviewer is that it only allows you to in/decrease fonts that are not specifically set by stylesheets or font tags in the source of those pages. So sometimes it is pretty useless to only increase the size of the titles for example.
 
I think it's an option the creator of the CHM specifies. In an old job we used to supply our help files as CHM (among other formats) and I'm sure that there was an option we had to set to get the "change font size" on the toolbar.
 
If you create a template named Blank.sta and store it in the Libraries:Defaults:Templates folder of either the Application folder or your User Folder it will be use any time you create a new blank document.
 
I have not find a solution, but it probably goes around the windows theme font and so on, I think Vectorworks or any software are "piggy backing" the windows for the font information. I will try and do more research on this.
 
Thanks for this. My desire is go a bit deeper. I want to change all tags, callouts, etc... from Arial to my clients desired font. Any way to do this? Currently I'm bringing in the tags and editing the style but this is painful.
 
My challenge is that I've run the script, changed the fonts (yeah!) and saved the file. I have run into a couple of issues. First: Using the data tag tool with a tag from the same group but of a different configuration it changes all existing tags back to Arial. Second: Once I placed all needed tags, saved the file, created the template and created a new file using the template the tags still use Arial. I want to change the font at the base level so with each new drawing users don't have to run the script. Is this even possible?
 
Also note, that you will need to pull all the data tag styles you want into the template and use them from there. The ones in the Default Contact in the application folder will likely revert to Arial even time VW is reinstalled (and maybe updated).
 
Fonts are pretty much an OS thing. I don't know if you could delete Arial from their computer and rename their font to Arial. Arial is so commonly used that this would likely cause all sorts of other problems so I don't recommend even testing it.
 
You could duplicate the Default Content file that contains the Tags into their Workgroup or User folders and edit the tags in there. If a file with the exact same name exists in the User or Workgroup and Applications folder, the once "closest" to the user takes priority and you will not see default content from the other folders. This would get you by until they upgrade to VW2023 an
