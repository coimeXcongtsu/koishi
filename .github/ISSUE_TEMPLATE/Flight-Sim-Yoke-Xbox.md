I have a Microsoft Force Feedback joystick, also have CH Products Flight Sim yoke andThrustmaster rudder pedals. Anyway to make any of these work to fly Flight Sim on XBox XS that I just bought? I find it very difficult to do anything with a game controller that young kids these days use. It almost makes me want to return my XBox game console. Very sad and frustrated and feel like going back to my PC and Flight Sim X. Any help would be great but using this game controller to fly is absolutely too hard
