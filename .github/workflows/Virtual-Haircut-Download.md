Personal services like haircuts are exempt from sales tax in most states but generally taxed in Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, and South Dakota. In New York City, haircuts are exempt from state sales tax but subject to New York City sales tax.
 
Unfortunately, businesses need to know what kind of service they provide in order to correctly tax it. In South Dakota, sales categorized as training and seminars or online training are generally subject to sales tax, like beauty and barbering services, but educational services are generally exempt. In West Virginia, beauty and barbering services are exempt but educational services, online training, and training and seminars all are typically taxed.

A traveling stylist who cuts hair up and down the Eastern Seaboard would likely need to be registered to do business in multiple states and tax their sales according to the rates and rules in effect in each location. But does a stylist working from home in New York City need to do the same when providing virtual cuts for clients residing in Yonkers, New York; Hoboken, New Jersey; or Maui, Hawaii? Possibly.
 
Haircuts are generally sourced to where the customer receives the service, which is where the head of hair is located. Similarly, education services are generally sourced to the location of the student, whether that student sits in a physical or virtual classroom.
 
Well, I have some good news about grooming during this abysmal time of COVIT-19. **Barba** in New York is giving instructions on how to cut hair at home. These are not lessons just for men, it a virtual class room for the entire family to spruce up while barbershops and beauty parlors are closed. Following is what you need to know.
 
Henson debuted virtual haircuts in May 2020****as a service available to certain clients who filled out a screening form.****After a few months, she realized that anyone could use her technique to cut their own hair, she said. By June 2020, she opened the virtual haircut booking system to the world.
 
First, the site recommends you buy a $48 kit, which comes with shears for cutting, clips for sectioning, and a stick for parting your hair. The site asks you to set up your laptop in front of a mirror so you can cut your hair and see the Zoom screen at the same time.
 
She wouldn't reveal too much about her technique but said her underlying philosophy is what she calls "kinetic techniques," which means she constantly moves the curls around while cutting in order to shape the hair.
 
Henson also teaches her methods at Daze Curl Education. She also hopes to expand, potentially, to AR/VR integrated haircuts. Her mission is to boost the curly hair education students get in cosmetology school, which typically advises stylists to wet the hair to make it straight, then cut it, she said, whereas Henson's highlights the unique aspects of each head of bendy hair.
 
In addition to commemorating the fallen freedom fighters of the Black Liberation Movement, Black August is a time to call for the release of political prisoners in the U.S., to condemn the oppressive conditions of U.S. prisons, and to emphasize the continued importance of the struggle for Black Liberation. This annual observance was created in the 1970s by Black freedom fighters who wanted to honor the lives and deaths of Black political prisoners killed by the state, bring awareness to prison conditions, and to honor the radical tradition of Black resistance against anti-Black state violence and systemic oppression.
 
Join African American male leaders from the sector as they dive into the historical value of Black August and discuss the long-lasting effects of systemic oppression we see today in communities. Discuss the challenges and opportunities for freedom and equity in communities of color that support voices that call for justice.
 
The barbershop is the one of the few safe places where Black men feel very comfortable in having candid conversations on just about anything. All over America, the barbershop continues to serve as a second home and place of refuge, healing, and compassion for Black men.
 
This virtual space will feature several Black male executives from around the country, sharing their experiences and recommendations for advancing anti-racist leadership and championing equity-focused action in human services organizations. Just like in any barbershop, anyone is welcome to drop in at any time based on their availability and interest.
 
In addition to the virtual appointments, the chain extended the reach of the effort with its mobile Golden M Detector, using AI and ML to detect the haircut and give out free Big Macs to people sporting the hairstyle. For those that didn't have the haircut already or missed out on the virtual appointments, a video tutorial extends the campaign's reach and could encourage more fans to wear the Golden Arches in their hair.
 
McDonald's this month also gave away free McRib sandwiches to the first 10,000 people who showed on social media that they shaved their facial hair after No-Shave November, an annual month-long event that raises money for cancer research, prevention and education. These efforts come as the chain announced plans to boost its marketing spend for the remainder of 2020 as it attempts to recover from lost sales resulting from pandemic-related lockdowns this year.
 
**The Challenge Using Virtual Backgrounds
**The holy-grail solution to generating a great virtual background is to place a green screen behind you that spans your entire background. Then, Zoom will create a beautiful chroma-keyed background using the green.
 
Hey, great stuff. When I started doing Zoom with a virtual background a few months ago, I had no problems. Lately, though, the black area above the top of my head is constantly moving, giving the appearance of my hair suddenly standing straight up at times. Any ideas on how to correct this? Thanks, Carl

Last year, virtual reality entered the Assembly of State Parties of the International Criminal Court with an official side event hosted by the Office of the Prosecutor. So we decided to look into how this new technology is entering international courtrooms and which opportunities and challenges it brings. And it turns out this conversation was well timed as in February a Colombian court was the first to hold a **hearing in the metaverse**.
 
To help us untangle what virtual reality actually entails we are joined by **Sarah Zarmsky**, visiting scholar at the Human Rights Center at the University of Berkeley, and **Brittan Heller**, lecturer in International Law at Standford University and previously at the ICC. For a hands-on perspective, we invited **Shirin Anlen**, media technologist at the human rights organisation **WITNESS**.
 
Shirin filled us in on the technicalities of creating a digital reconstruction model and how the human biases and the freedom of this medium balance out. And we ask all three experts where digital reconstruction is going in and outside international courtrooms.
 
Related to the field, Sarah suggests **Digital Witness**, while to unwind she opts for cycling classes and the series **The Last of Us** on HBO. Shirin is also a big fan of the Last of Us and has recently gotten into dog training. Brittan manages to balance work and family as her 6-month-old daughter seems to particularly like hearing her talk about technology and law.
 
This podcast has been produced as part of a partnership with **JusticeInfo.net**, an independent website in French and English covering justice initiatives in countries dealing with serious violence. It is a media outlet of Fondation Hirondelle, based in Lausanne, Switzerland.

He's a hairstylist who's led more than a hundred haircuts via Zoom in the last few weeks. He's worked with clients all over the world: Germany, Dubai, China and Paris, France. One day, he said, he was so busy he had nine back-to-back appointments.
 
I found Anderson through a website called YouProbablyNeedaHaircut, which launched in early April. It's a side project for tech entrepreneur Greg Isenberg. He got the idea after talking to a friend in New York City who had lost his job as a barber due to the coronavirus.
 
"So I was like, how about you hop on FaceTime, you teach her, and I'll give you some money. And we did it, and it was pretty cool. And I realized, maybe other people out there might want a similar service," he said.
 
"Now I'm able to provide for my rent, I have a you
