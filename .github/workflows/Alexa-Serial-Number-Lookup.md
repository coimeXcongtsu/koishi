My prime source for all contacts is Office 365 (Outlook). This automatically syncs to iPhone, Alexa and previously my BT Premium Phone (snapshot because I didn't want my mobile to ring for landline calls).

In preparation I created a temporary Gmail user as that has a free export to vCard. I decided to filter out all contacts with no telephone number (this may not be necessary) just in case SH2 created contacts with no telephone number. However this did cause a few problems (see below).
 
2. Open that file in Excel (problem, Excel strips the leading zero off all unformatted telephone numbers!) Lucky for me 90% of my telephone numbers are formatted 01234 567890. I have subsequently formatted all my contacts for future snapshots.
 
However as mentioned above my initial load (Excel) had stripped some leading zeros. So I exported from SH2 to a backup vcf file and opened it up in Notepad and added in the missing leading zeros. I wont have to do that again as I have now formatted all my telephone numbers in Outlook. Clear and imported back to SH2.
 
Thanks for that. It's essentially what I did except you have explained it much more clearly than I succeeded in doing. I had 900 contacts but that was largely as a result of poor housekeeping on my part and I deleted the ones that were surplus to requirements.

On top of that some numbers had a "-" between exchange and number fields but this was easily removed by using find and replace in sheets and I similarly removed all space characters from the number fields
 
The record fields for version 2.1 are different and although after removing the photos I was able to import it into the smart hub, the alexa phone was only able to show one contact number for each contact. However the contact numbers were all imported and it was only when I did an export from the hub that I found that all the contact numbers had been labelled in the version 4 file as type none and only the first one for each contact was available on the alexa phone. I then had to edit the vcf dump from the smart hub to change the number types from none to home, cell or work. I then re-imported the file into the hub and all the contact numbers were now visible - but you can only have one number of each type (home, cell and work) for each contact - so if for instance you set 2 tel numbers as cell, only the first one will be visible.
 
I didn't note down the amount of text associated with the photo but it is a round a page and a half of text and usually seems to be at the end of each contact record so you need to remove until you see
 
In our Mac Contacts app, we have quite a few contacts with multiple phone numbers. I exported the contacts in vCard format and imported them into the BT Hub, but only one number for each contact is showing up on the Advanced Digital Phone even if the contact's various phone numbers are of different types (HOME, WORK and CELL). Any thoughts as to why that could be?
 
Another question: Someone else wrote that embedded spaces in phone numbers prevent the Caller ID function from mapping the phone number of an incoming call to a name in the Contacts. Does that apply to hyphens (which you have in your examples) or to parentheses, which I see in some of our phone numbers?
 
The ECHO Clean Air Tracking Tool (ECATT) is a US EPA interface and repository for Clean Air Act data that can be used to evaluate emissions at stationary sources of air pollution and analyze general air quality.
 
The **Air Monitoring Station** (AMS) search provides data about U.S. air monitoring stations that measure ambient or outdoor concentrations of Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) and Criteria Air Pollutants (CAPs). The search can be used to identify areas with high pollutant concentrations and higher potential for health impacts and identify the facilities emitting in those areas. Read more about HAPs and CAPs.
 
The AMS search also incorporates AirToxScreen modeled data so users can identify areas with elevated cancer risk or higher potential for other health impacts and compare those areas to nearby emissions concentrations measured by air monitors to identify potential risk hotspots. Users can screen facilities for further evaluation by identifying measured pollutant concentrations larger than the modeled amount.
 
"Define Year As" allows you to select either the "Best Rolling 12 Months of Data" or "Calendar Year." EPA established the following criteria to select the Best Rolling 12 Months of Data to represent annual concentrations:
 
"NAAQ Standard" allows you to select only the Primary pollutant standard, only the Secondary pollutant standard, or not specify by selecting "No Restrictions." EPA established the following criteria to define the two standards:
 
Select air monitoring stations located in areas with an 80th or higher percentile of one or more of the supplemental indexes of EJScreen, EPA's screening tool for environmental justice (EJ) concerns. EPA uses these indexes to identify geographic areas that may warrant further consideration or analysis for potential EJ concerns.
 
Note that use of this criterion does not designate an area as an "EJ community" or "EJ facility." EJScreen provides screening level indicators, not a determination of the existence or absence of EJ concerns. For more information, see the EJScreen home page.
 
The Supplemental Index uses a five-factor demographic index that averages Percent Low Income , Percent Unemployed , Percent Limited English Speaking, Percent Less than High School Education, and Low Life Expectancy.
 
This option selects whether national percentiles or state percentiles are used when determining if a location has one or more of EJScreen's indexes at or above the 80th percentile. The default is national percentiles.
 
Site codes are unique for stations within a county. If only a site code is provided, ECATT will display all air monitoring stations with that site code. Similarly, ECATT will display all air monitoring stations within the state or county if only a state or county code is given respectively. You can search for multiple IDs by using a comma-separated list.
 
A nonattainment area is an area that does not meet one or more of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six commonly found air pollutants ("criteria pollutants") designated in the Clean Air Act: particle pollution (often referred to as particulate matter), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead.
 
When the pollutant selected is "Aggregate Pollutants" this searches for the cumulative risk for all monitored pollutants at a station. This search option allows users to identify areas of potential cancer risk and is not intended to provide a comparison between stations, as stations may monitor for different numbers and types of pollutants.
 
Search for monitors measuring air pollutant concentrations exceeding a specific hazard quotient level. Select a specific target organ or organ system and a hazard quotient level of 1, 2, 10, 25, 50 or 100. Hazard quotient indicates the ratio of the potential exposure to an air pollutant and the level at which no adverse effects are expected. A hazard quotient less than or equal to 1 indicates that adverse effects are not likely to occur, and thus can be considered to have negligible hazard.
 
Select "Yes" to compare the monitored pollutant concentrations to AirToxScreen modeled pollutant concentrations. Set a factor to compare 75% of ambient daily average pollutant measurements against the modeled values.
 
When a pollutant concentration is reported as "not detected," its actual concentration may be zero or some value between zero and the detection limit. The user can choose to calculate the average pollutant concentration using one of three methods: setting all non-detects to zero, setting all non-detects to the detection limit, or using the regression method. By default, non-detects are set to use regression method. See the Air Monitoring Station Data Rules and Calculations for more information.
 
AirToxScreen is EPA's comprehensive evaluation of air toxics in the United States, based on modeled air quality. These activities include the expansion of air toxics monitoring, improvement and periodic updating of emission inventories, improvement of national- and local-scale modeling, continued research on health effects and exposures to both ambient and indoor air, and improvement of assessment tools. AirToxScreen provides a snapshot of the outdoor air quality and the risks to human health that would result if air toxic emission levels remained unchanged. More information on AirToxScreen can be found on the EPA AirToxScreen Frequently Asked Questions page.
 
Select a Pollutant through the lookup. Then select a Cancer Risk and risk level. For example, searching on "Formaldehyde" and "Background > 25" will return ambient emission stations where the cancer risk level for the pollutant is greater than 25 in 1 million.
 
**Hazard Quotient** indicates the ratio of the potential exposure to an air pollutant and the level at which no adverse effects are expected for an organ or organ system. A hazard quotient less than or equal to 1 indicates that adverse effects are not likely to occur, and thus can be considered to have negligible hazard.
 
**Hazard Index** is the sum of hazard quotients for substances that affect the same target organ or organ system. Because different air toxics can cause similar adverse health effects, combining hazard quotients from different toxics is often appropriate. A hazard index (HI) of 1 or l
