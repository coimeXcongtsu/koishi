With the influx of Japanese Bubble Era cars I expect there will be greater demand for that to change. Maybe we can be the vehicle of that change.

While unpacking my shop I came across the first DIYPNP I built. It's a bit ugly. Notice the MAP sensor? No matter; I'm going to pull this apart and rebuild it for the EA11R. I'm also going to start putting together a custom board to run an MS3Pro Module after this, but for now this will work.
 
I'm a fellow Cappuccino owner, I picked mine up in March of last year with the thought of making it my daily. Unfortunately ran into some issues with some of the coolant hoses that run under the intake plenum which are impossible to access without removing the intake itself, and it's been sitting in the garage on jackstands for a few months now. Eventually I'll get it back on the road again, but look forward to see what you do with yours!

Car went up on jack stands tonight for the engine pull. According to the manual, it goes out the bottom. There's a lot on this car which impresses me. More-so than an NA Miata, which gets a lot of attention for its engineering. I'll try to get pictures and document it some tomorrow.
 
It's in the factory service manual, and while it looks a bit intimidating at first, it hasn't been that bad thus far. According to the manual the whole front subframe with suspension, engine, and trasmission goes out the bottom and then the major components can be separated.
 
Anything that you found that you needed to do that was missing from the manual? Did you have to disconnect the AC lines (didn't see this mentioned at all in the manual)? I have almost everything done, except I need to unbolt the driveshaft, and disconnect the suspension from the body. Should be attempting to drop the engine this weekend when I return from my trip to Japan.
 
To get the steering shaft off we unbolted the rack from the front of the subframe, pulled the shaft out of the rack, and then bolted the rack back up. It was still very difficult to get around. I suggest removing the alternator to make it easier.
 
Driving 20.000 km around Bali and surrounding islands over the last 2 years, I used a Honda Vario 110ccm CBS, which was a great way to use as my day-2-day vehicle. So when Honda came out with the 2012 model, I naturally had to take a closer look. Here is what I think about that bike after using it for 1 month and app. 1.000 kilometer:
 
Indonesia is a vast country, consisting of more than 15.000 islands with diverse natural settings; mountains, hills, beach, curvy slopes, ride paddies with quite a modern road infrastructure, compared to other, less developed Asian countries.
 
Honda seems to be quite confident with the new Vario engine. The service manual now asks for you to do regular service checkups every 4.000 kilometers. The first should be done when you reach 1.000km (previously 500km), then next at 2.000km (previously 1.000), then 4.000km and every additional 4.000km only. Alone for warranty reasons this is great, as you have to visit a garage less often to maintain your initial warranty in the first years of owning the bike.
 
When I read you good comment about this kind of Vario, suddenly I missed my Kymco. Yes, Kymco have almost those feature from far years ago, like big tank, big compartment, all in one key (just switch your one key to open seat).
