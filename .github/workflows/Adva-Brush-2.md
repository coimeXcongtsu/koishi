You are over worrying the ISP network. That is their problem, OSPF/MPLS etc has nothing to do with you if you are just buying internet access and they have given you an iP and default gateway. (if you are not buying internet and this is mpls etc then it is a completely different scenario and they are not an ISP but a service provider).
 
The best way to test is just connect the ethernet to a laptop configured with the ip details. you can then run more advanced diagnostics, ping see if you get an arp etc. If the laptop works then connect to the draytek.
 
I suspect I had configured the Draytek fine for WAN Ethernet with static IP and the VLAN OSPF idea from the host selling me the line, was them trying desperately to blame my router instead of their service.
 
I put my Draytek back on the end of the Ethernet WAN feed, removed the VLAN nonsense the host told me to add, put it back to how I originally set it up, just as Static IP, with an IPV4 address, subnet and gateway and it worked.
 
A Surgical Scrub Brush is a specialized cleaning tool used to perform a thorough hand and arm scrub before entering the operating room or conducting a surgical procedure. It is designed to remove dirt, debris, and microorganisms from the skin, in order to maintain strict aseptic techniques in healthcare settings.

The brush features stiff bristles or sponge material attached to a handle, allowing for effective scrubbing and cleaning of the hands, fingers, nails, and forearms. The surgical scrub brushes are equipped with a nail cleaner, which allows for thorough cleaning of the nails and surrounding areas.
 
Surgical scrub brushes are available with the antimicrobial agents povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine gluconate solution 4%. They are available packaged as individual pieces or in 30 blister packs in a dispenser, which provides convenient and hygienic access to the brushes where needed.
 
AdvaCare Pharma is a leading manufacturer and distributor of Surgical Scrub Brushes, which have been produced in facilities located in India, China, and the USA. These facilities regularly undergo stringent audits in order to ensure their compliance with ISO/CE regulations.
 
**Povidone-Iodine** surgical scrub brush is used to mechanically scrub the skin, assisting in the removal of microorganisms and debris. It consists of bristles attached to a handle; the bristles have been treated with povidone-iodine.
 
Povidone-iodine exhibits a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. It works by releasing free iodine, which disrupts microbial cell walls and denatures proteins. The antimicrobial action is immediate, and it maintains its efficacy for a limited duration following application.
 
**Chlorhexidine Gluconate Solution 4%** surgical scrub brush is used for preoperative skin preparation. It consists of bristles attached to a handle; the bristles have been treated with a 4% solution of chlorhexidine gluconate.
 
Chlorhexidine gluconate displays broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties, effectively targeting a variety of bacteria, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains, as well as certain fungi. Compared to povidone-iodine, it offers prolonged antimicrobial effects and does not cause skin discoloration or staining.

The package should be opened and placed on the back of the scrub sink with the brush still in the package). After an initial pre-scrub wash, the sterile brush is removed from the opened package and used to thoroughly clean the arms, forearms, and under the nails. It should be noted to use the sponge side of the brush for the skin and the nail brush only for under the nails. Special care should be taken to ensure that the hands remain above the level of the elbows and away from attire in order to avoid splashing.
 
Used surgical scrub brushes should be disposed of in accordance with healthcare facility protocols and guidelines for medical waste disposal. In most cases, used brushes are considered regulated medical waste and should be placed in designated medical waste containers.
 
Povidone-Iodine exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against many types of microorganisms. It works by releasing free iodine, which disrupts cell walls and denatures proteins.
