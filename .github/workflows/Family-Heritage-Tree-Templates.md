Asking your class to build family trees also has wider benefits. It helps children get a grasp not only on the concept of their wider family structure, but it can help them begin to appreciate their own roots and the generational journey that their family has been on.

A common way of visually showing the relationship between generations is to use a family tree. If you've ever wondered why it's called a family tree, the answer has to do with the way a normal tree is structured. While the roots are considered the ancestors, the branches are the children. One thing you have to keep in mind when making a family tree chart is to also allow the future members of your family to add their own names to the family tree.
 
A family tree can provide a simple way of visualizing a person's family history and ancestors. The following blank family tree templates can help you with easily showcasing the members of your family in pleasant and original manner.
 
There are multiple types of family tree charts with the most popular one being the ancestor chart or ancestor tree. It's in ascending order, which means it usually starts from the bottom with the name of the person making it(you) and it goes upwards listing the parents, grandparents, great-grandparents and so forth, depending on the number of generations are required. Other types of family trees include hourglass charts, the starting person is in the middle with the parents and grandparents above and the children and grandchildren below. Another known one is a family unit history or family group record which details a couple's information including names, dates and places of birth, dates and places of death, marriage and their children.
 
Depending on how many generations have to be listed in your family tree we have chosen the most popular ones: 4 generation family trees, 5 generation family trees, 6 generation family trees and for those that need to go back further, 7 generation family trees.
 
In the case of an ancestor tree your name(the name of the person making the family tree) should be at the bottom(or left) and the name of the parents, grandparents and maybe great-grandparents should expand upwards or towards the right. If you choose one our free family tree templates you don't have to worry about this because most of them are labeled.
 
For a basic family tree the information you have to gather includes the names of your parents and grandparents. If you need to add your siblings then the names of your brothers and/or sisters are also necessary. For a multiple generations family tree the great-grandparents and maybe even the great-great-grandparents will be needed. If you're planning to make an extended family tree then the names of your uncles, aunts and cousins are required.
