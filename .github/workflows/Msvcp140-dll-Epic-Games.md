I have managed to get the launcher installed, however after logging in I have a problem where the window is black with occasional seemingly random flickers of text and icons showing. The occurrance of the flickers seems to be tied to mouse movement, but not necessarily where the cursor is at the time. Any thoughts out there on what may be causing this?

Did you install dxvk? I had a similar issue with uplay but this command solved the issue /opt/cxoffice/bin/cxfix --auto . If none of these tricks fix the issue please post a cxlog file. Execute epic gmaes launcher with option and flag create a cxlogfile option.
 
Is the glitches still present after dxvk? Did you try to enable a virtual desktop maybe it can help. The log file doesn't show anything that wrong except some 32 bit libraries not present... If the trick does not work try to create another log file but this time set these parameters click on the symbol "+" and chose window behaviour and graphics as parameters. These debug options will give more information than common debug.
 
Did you try changing your windows manager? Metacity gave me some issues few times. Try different managers and see if something changes, try the latest dxvk and last but not least this command if you didn't already /opt/cxoffice/bin/cxfix --auto

I've tried a different windows manager same results. Everything installed is at the latest version and cxfix reports no issues. It may be that this is a problem that isn't fixable at this time. I know there have been issues with this application, just figured I'd give it a shot and see if I can make things work, especially since it seems that the primary issue is getting it installed for most people.

I've successfully installed and logged in my epic games account. Did you use my crosstie for epic games launcher?
As stated in the tip section of my crosstie, if the application fails to update or run, try to install dxvk. Check and uncheck it if the appliction fails to run. A caveat though latest update broke the rendering of the launcher so it's unstable it blinks but it allows to run games, maybe futures dxvk's updates will fix the problem.

Did you install the software through the crosstie? The client, it's barely usable because the rendering it's broken but with a little bit of patience you can browse the library and launch games. I was able to log in and all. The only error I had was during the updating process, I had to force quit and then launch once with dxvk and another time with dxvk unchecked and then the login screen was prompted. I accessed to my account with no issues. I repeat the rendering of the client is completely broken, with dxvk it blinks and you can, with a lot of patience browse its content.

I used Crossover App list menu to install Epic games launcher. It's the same thing? Sorry I'm a newbie..
The application installs but when I start it with DXVK active, a black screen appears with a blue progress bar at the bottom and then an error window related to Epicgameshelper.exe appears. If I close the error window, another one appears and the login window does not appear. I can only access the settings from the gear icon at the bottom. I can only visualize that. If I disable DXVK, nothing changes, with the difference that the blue bar does not appear and I do not see the settings. Just the black screen and Epicgameshelper.exe error window. I don't really know how. I have an iMac with Catalina.
 
Yes I'm italian. ok you installed it through my crosstie. Your error could be related to some missing dependency. If you are on linux run this command: /opt/cxoffice/bin/cxfix --auto . This command will install every secondary dependency needed to crossover in order to work at its full potential. Install these libraries and then try to run epic games launcher again using the trick of running it with and without dxvk. If it fails delete the bottle and re install the software again it should work. Keep me updated Buon Natale
 
Ciao Simone, grazie della risposta! I have an Imac with MacOs Catalina. I understand that the command you recommended only works on Linux. Is there something for Mac too? I have installed Epic Launcher about ten times, both via crosstie and from the .msi file downloaded from the Epic site, but the error I get is always the same. I also tried with a Win 7 - 32 bit bottle and the error doesn't show up. I managed to log in but then I had some display problems that made everything unusable and so I uninstalled it. I also tried running the launcher with the -opengl command, as suggested by some users, but I have no luck.
Buon Natale anche a te
 
As Stated before using the default settings (the one used in the crosstie) you can login and all with no issues, but latest client's updates have broken the rendering, using dxvk, made the window blink so it's barely usable, with a lot of patience and frustration, you can browse your library.
